results would qualitatively different black hole evolved time yet calculation would much harder Indeed interacting radiation black hole modes become mixed anyway expect entropy start rising zero quickly first approached maximum value would decay behavior black hole folks fairly used calculation performed Page 1993 shows essentially exactly behavior Page constructed entirely abstract quantum information-theoretic scenario suppose pure bi-partite state like start black hole one half bi-partitite state radiation field bc let two systems interact via random unitaries Basically asked entropy

time would essentially impossible determine radiation field joint field actually pure state said black hole physics random unitaries used calculation well random Say use U_ rm tri instead interaction

invented wavefunction describe behaviour devised equation allowed physicists calculate given situation1 neither anyone else could say anything wavefunction's nature Ignorance bliss practical perspective nature matter textbook Copenhagen interpretation quantum theory developed 1920s mainly physicists Niels Bohr Werner Heisenberg treats wavefunction nothing tool predicting results observations cautions physicists concern reality looks like underneath can't blame physicists following 'shut calculate' ethos led tremendous developments nuclear physics atomic physics solid-state physics particle physics says Jean Bricmont statistical physicist Catholic University Louvain Belgium people say let's worry big questions physicists worried anyway 1930s Albert Einstein rejected Copenhagen interpretation least allowed two particles entangle wavefunctions producing situation measurements one could instantaneously determine state even particles separated vast distances Rather accept spooky action distance Einstein preferred believe particles' wavefunctions incomplete Perhaps suggested particles kind 'hidden variables' determine outcome measurement quantum theories capture Experiments since shown spooky action distance quite real rules particular version hidden variables Einstein advocated stopped physicists coming interpretations interpretations fall two broad camps agree Einstein wavefunction represents ignorance philosophers call psi-epistemic models view wavefunction real entity psi-ontic models appreciate difference consider thought experiment Schr dinger

Australia perform similar tests ions easier track photons Within next six months could watertight version experiment says Maroney even efforts succeed wavefunction-as-reality models favoured models come variety flavours experimenters still pick apart One earliest interpretations set 1920s French physicist Louis de Broglie8 expanded 1950s US physicist David Bohm9 10 According de Broglie Bohm models particles definite locations properties guided kind 'pilot wave' often identified wavefunction would explain double-slit experiment pilot wave would able travel slits produce interference

basic concept behind phononic computing straightforward Acoustic phonons different amplitudes could represent 0s 1s computing would correspond sound waves relatively low frequency beginning pitches within range human hearing beyond around million cycles per second high-frequency phonons -- billions cycles per second -- typically transport heat within material harnessing phonons computing device

discovered surprising results extreme temperature gradients generated particle scale think greatest significance work rigorously showed certain classes essentially nonequilibrium systems exactly described terms equilibrium's statistical mechanics e one derive pseudo-Hamiltonian describes systems Ivlev Max Planck Institute Extraterrestrial Physics Garching Germany told Phys org One amazing implications example one observe mixture two liquids detailed equilibrium yet liquid temperature One example system nonreciprocal interactions researchers experimentally demonstrated study involves charged microparticles levitating electrode plasma chamber violation Newton's third law arises fact system involves two types microparticles levitate different heights due different sizes densities electric field chamber drives vertical plasma flow like current river charged microparticle focuses flowing plasma ions downstream creating vertical plasma wake behind Although repulsive forces occur due direct interactions two layers particles reciprocal attractive particle-wake forces two layers wake forces decrease distance electrode layers levitating different heights result lower layer exerts larger total force upper layer particles upper layer exerts lower layer particles Consequently upper layer higher average kinetic energy thus higher temperature lower layer tuning electric field researchers could also increase height difference two layers increases temperature difference Usually I'm rather conservative thinking sort 'immediate' potential application particular discovery least physics might Ivlev said However quite confident results provide important step towards better understanding certain kinds nonequilibrium systems numerous examples different nonequilibrium systems action-reaction symmetry broken interparticle interactions show one nevertheless find underlying symmetry allows us describe systems terms textbook equilibrium statistical mechanics plasma experiment example action-reaction symmetry breaking 2D system symmetry breaking occur 3D systems well scientists expect types systems exhibit unusual remarkable behavior hope investigate systems future current research focused several topics direction Ivlev said One effect action-reaction symmetry breaking overdamped colloidal suspensions nonreciprocal interactions lead remarkably rich variety

physical experiments traditional motors can't move AFM tips nanoscopic precision necessary experiments tip cantilever mounted driven piezoelectric plate top layer type plate shifts laterally away bottom layer certain voltage applied pushing cantilever tip across sample surface resolution required atomic friction study scanner inside commercial AFM reach hundred nanometers per second Carpick said That's intrinsic limitation instrument go top speed get large oscillations signal solution make compact shear piezo plate use move sample instead tip moving sample thin film gold coated silicon die instead tip driven much heavier scanner Penn team able radically increase experiment's overall speed lower mass smaller plate move faster without causing noisy oscillations relative motion Liu said means go thousand times faster maintaining resolution need add entirely new electronics capturing data well since one record fast Penn team speeding systems UC Merced team slowing researchers took advantage relatively long periods inactivity tip stuck waiting enough energy slip forward energy provided relative motion sample tip random vibrations atoms involved resulting thermal energy make slipping transition occur faster slower Recognizing Martini said gives us ability use suite simulation tools called 'infrequent event systems ' tools making infrequent events happen quickly still
