California potent spirit consumers legally buy 151 proof 75 5 percent alcohol lucky states proof get 190s let us state clearly truly know Palcohol recipe manufacturing process works almost certainly utilizes high-proof spirit cut volume powder needed make single drink also possible instead using maltodextrin Palcohol uses cyclodextrin Like maltodextrin cyclodextrin derived starch structure
