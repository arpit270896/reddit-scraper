something like Battlestar Galactica reboot even die-hard classic Battlestar fans learn enjoy Although given Straczynski creativity imagination hard understand cannot simply come new material based extensive Babylon 5 lore already existence wouldn necessarily involve picking story left although series' ending open door number story possibilities course series made-for-TV movies many opportunities spin-offs presented Rangers good example bad example prefer since series failed picked following release pilot Legend Rangers story arcs also left unexplored course series' five seasons

secondary characters original series become fan favourites notably Vir Cotto Zack Allen would fun see Conaway's Zack Allen President Sheridan puts Objects Rest It's good know least one old gang sticking around little Allen replied Absolutely I'll probably still turn lights Allen stay till end saw series finale Sleeping Light takes places 10 years later Unfortunately since Jeff Conaway left us 2011 role would recast Stephen Furst's Vir Cotto also fan favourite would go play major role Babylon 5 universe eventually becoming Emperor Centauri Empire following death Londo Mollari brief glimpse get Emperor Cotto series finale showed us version Vir Cotto usual buffoon would great see went continue Mollari's work repair damages done Centauri Empire Shadows allies Drakh Old favourite

old favourites fans baffled Lennier's sudden betrayal inexplicable love-induced madness pretty much left President Sheridan die exposure coolant leak Objects Rest Lennier's affection Delenn recurring subtext series despite rash decision join Rangers Long Night Londo Mollari season 5 episode 2 little foreshadowing would eventually let resentment Sheridan's marriage Delenn drive mad Delenn said idea Lennier ran away puzzling actions also opened door interesting new adventures last time saw Lennier stolen one-man flyer fleeing parts unknown probably beyond Rim Lennier's character interesting Minbari Religious Cast extensive combat experience also underwent Rangers training never found happened imagine life adventure awaited beyond frontier known space beyond Rim renegade mercenary would interesting opportunity explore darker side Babylon 5 universe Lennier could also pop spin-offs made-for-TV movies 3 Life Times Sheridan Delenn Son first interesting tidbit Sheridan's Delenn's son

series Unfortunately Andreas Katsulas passed away 2006 actor would really hard time stepping great genre actor's shoes 5 Legends Rangers made-for-TV movie flop series picked reason try especially current popularity genre shows Rangers pure space opera gold kick-ass spaceships even look like plucked chickens elite warrior society strong mystical ties cool aliens dozens intriguing worlds material makings great series pilot go wrong Take pick weak script wooden performances even Katsulas appears sort cameo etc great idea given bad treatment since everything getting rebooted nowadays reboot Legend Rangers instead original Babylon 5 series 6 Crusade Take 2 Re See Legend Rangers made-for-TV movie Call Arms kind pilot Crusade series building commissioning super starship search cure plague unleashed Earth Drakh Call Arms wasn't bad actually certainly moments Crusade didn't follow suite even though plenty going characters lot potential including alien thief Dureena Nafeel
