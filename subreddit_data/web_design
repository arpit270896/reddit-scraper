('How to constructively get opinions on your design work', "BlogMenuSign UpAbout WebflowBlogBuild cool stuff Without code ask design feedbackNeal O Grady www neal isShare post Read ArticlesEmail PostsLeave CommentHow ask design feedbackNever hear yeah looks fine anyone Oh it's good like looks nice Good colors dude gotta get back work minute bet ve heard feedback like helpful right actually wanted precise actionable feedback improve design work vague statements ve ever asked friend colleague feedback design likely responses received perhaps coupled shy smile discomfort tried avoid hurting feelings fruitlessness leads many designers tune feedback entirely go mockup production entirely instincts right path Nope ll see feedback vital right way ask feedback get good thoughts everyone every time ask We're going learn post feedback importantWhen done correctly receiving feedback valuable part designer process doesn matter experienced designer Without feedback people cannot sure work appreciated understood anyone approximately three billion people world Internet connection completely different set experiences biases preferences Trying design anything isolation opinion madness people also provide insights never would occurred thanks unique set experiences skills Draw diversity use advantage Personally always blog posts site designs reviewed several people publishing ensures coherent understandable engaging provide actual value others re crazy ramblings filled errors website design particular second pair eyes helps ensure 1 design visually pleasing variety tastes 2 designer intentions clear ask feedbackOften receive generic feedback blame person asked mistake rests us mistake natural though communicating complex questions answers skill re born need social hacks need tricks master communication process important aspect getting insightful actionable feedback create environment person re asking feedback comfortable possible Stress anxiety ruin ability think clearly critically fear insulting others prevents us saying really think Don't stress people dawgThis example ready-to-go tweet would fun include within article make easy retweet phrase order create environment comfort need re going explore concepts learn associated techniques Give people advanced notice plus ample time review work Never surprise someone put spot feedback get turn hurried superficial Tell person exactly re looking know kind feedback want answer accordingly Free reign isn always great idea people need constrained focus perform well Limit options significantly easier make decision two options undefined range aware conveying feedback saying might uncover thoughts might know express Give working prototype instead mockup watch use instantly receive valuable insights usability Let explore master time level feedback game Tell type feedback wantWhen someone asks review edit critique anything always numerous questions purpose coming feedback want give thumbs-up high-five want detailed no-holds-barred constructive criticism even finest details someone asks review essay school need know want look spelling errors give critical analysis argument goes design Designs critiqued dozen factors people don't experience differentiate one factor next don't instruct people re specifically looking feedback ll settle somewhere safe side going particularly helpful trick ask different people critique different parts design double people ask aggregate responses Give people timeImagine re meeting re surrounded designers managers stakeholders Like people meeting thoughts wander lunch work weekend suddenly manager points asks talk latest project Cue stock photo dreaded meetingYou freeze Flustered unprepared stumble words hope make sense sound confident ultimately re stressed cannot think clearly similar like walk someone office interrupt train thought say Hey Susan Nice weather Hey think shoving laptop face design work full display Errr uh well nice colors well hmmm red nice Yeah good Good job taken surprise rushed come something insightful they'd seem useful smart Seem keyword re actually useful would required time sincere thought give people time consider respond get really considerate answer give work advance ask take look short discussion near respectable future later day 5 minutes Consider asking take notes pressing thoughts consider specific questions send along designs Ask specific questionsEver asked Tell interview Well didn prepare canned response question probably blundered quick answer got wrong foot Open-ended general questions difficult answer know asker wants hear asking specific questions person answering feel confident answering guideline want actually know confidence means insight insight means better feedback Continuing interview example questions primary duties X experience designing sites using Webflow much direct consequently easier insightfully answer applicant design-specific examples text legible background purpose website product button draw attention Limit optionsWould find easier choose two cars asked choose every luxury car world re optometrist office compare effectiveness various lenses Remember re always comparing two lenses time powerful reason Imagine gave twenty lenses asked choose best one rank order best worst Wow much harder memory isn good perception two options vastly easier say one better think best color leads Um well m quite sure several million Avoid Instead try look better red red look better image centered left-aligned keep iterating questions long friend patience keep thoughtfully answering Oh ya Make sure patient friends Good luck one Ask likeIn interview Kevin Rose Elon Musk CEO Tesla SpaceX talked greater importance receiving negative feedback asking people hate love goes say despite constructive negativity immense value design process unfortunately avoided managers managers people alike fragile sensitive re asking feedback first time hustled project comfort isolation blame want reassured didn't waste time garbage work counter-constructive intuition need train ignore truth sake you're working need hear praise people love need know hate turn something acceptable great several iterations fixing biggest pain points hopefully question hate met Nothing looks perfect actually maximize benefit process necessary create environment person sufficiently comfortable openly criticize design brings us Accept feedback gracefullyThe important step receiving valuable feedback honing ability receive constructive criticism graciously genuine smile Instead feeling insulted embarrassed appreciative discovered drew attention faults spending energy benefit re passive aggressive simply dead silent response counter-productive jerk Plus consider lot better ego career openly handle criticism friend later hear client instead Listen friends incorporate feedback appropriate first difficult react negatively every little nitpick promise become easier time practice detach work realize direct extension Instead outcome creative process constantly evolving improving criticism work criticism abilities pointing improved rest good Notice saying sayingMany people find difficult express included top people want appear ignorant generally want insult realities manifest people say Put another way reveal people express feedback Perhaps notice friend point something remain silent begin say something backtrack respond Good like high-pitched blas tone signs missed opportunities constructive feedback person something potentially super useful say isn bad gets re wasting time need put person ease immediately Make natural criticize start criticising work light-hearted fashion recognize think work always epitome perfection politely reassure

CSS Share Twitter Share FacebookThe End Global CSSCSS selectors exist within global scope Anyone worked CSS long enough come terms aggressively global nature model clearly designed age documents struggling offer sane working environment today modern web applications Every selector potential unintended side effects targeting unwanted elements clashing selectors surprisingly selectors may even lose global specificity war ultimately little effect page time make change CSS file need carefully consider global environment styles sit front end technology requires much discipline keep code minimum level maintainability doesn way time leave era global style sheets behind time local CSS languages accepted modifying globalenvironment something done rarely ever JavaScript community thanks tools like Browserify Webpack JSPM expected code consist small modules encapsulating explicit dependencies exporting minimal API Yet somehow CSS still seems getting free pass Many us included recently working CSS long see lack local scope problem solve without significant help browser vendors Even d still need wait majority users using browser proper Shadow DOM support ve worked around issues global scope series naming conventions like OOCSS SMACSS BEM SUIT providing way us avoid naming collisions emulate sane scoping rules undoubtedly massive step forward taming CSS none methodologies addressed real problem style sheets matter convention choose re still stuck global selectors changed April 22 2015 covered earlier post Block Element Modifying JavaScript Components leverage Webpack import CSS within JavaScript module sounds unfamiliar probably good idea go read article lest miss importance follow Using Webpack css-loader importing component CSS looks like require ' MyComponent css' first glance even ignoring fact re importing CSS rather JavaScript quite strange Typically require call provide something local scope doesn sure sign global side effect introduced often symptom poor design CSS global side effects necessary evil thought April 22 2015 Tobias Koppers ever tireless author Webpack committed first iteration new feature css-loader time called placeholders known local scope feature allows us export class names CSS consuming JavaScript code short instead writing require ' MyComponent css' write import styles ' MyComponent css' example styles evaluate see exported CSS let take look example style sheet might look like local foo color red local bar color blue case ve used css-loader custom local identifier syntax export two identifiers foo bar identifiers map class strings use JavaScript file example using React import styles ' MyComponent css' import React Component 'react' export default class MyComponent extends Component render return div div className styles foo Foo div div className styles bar Bar div div Importantly identifiers map class strings guaranteed unique global context longer need add lengthy prefixes selectors simulate scoping components could define foo bar identifiers unlike traditional global selector model wouldn produce naming collisions critical recognise massive shift occurring make changes CSS confidence re accidentally affecting elements elsewhere page ve introduced sane scoping model CSS benefits global CSS style re-use components via utility classes etc still achievable model key difference like work technologies need explicitly import classes depend code make many assumptions global environment Writing maintainable CSS encouraged careful adherence naming convention style encapsulation development result scoping model ve handed control actual class names Webpack Luckily something configure default css-loader transforms identifiers hashes example local foo compiled _1rJwx92-gmbvaLiDdzgXiJ development isn terribly helpful debugging purposes make classes useful configure class format Webpack config parameter css-loader loaders test css loader 'css localIdentName name __ local ___ hash base64 5 ' case foo class identifier earlier would compile MyComponent__foo___1rJwx clearly see name identifier well component came Using node_env environment variable configure different class patterns development production loader 'css localIdentName ' process env NODE_ENV 'development' ' name __ local ___ hash base64 5 ' ' hash base64 5 ' Webpack control class names triviallyadd support minified classes production soon discovered feature didn hesitate localise styles recent project already scoping CSS component BEM convention natural fit Interestingly pattern quickly emerged CSS files contained nothing local identifiers local backdrop local root_isCollapsed backdrop local field local field focus etc Global selectors required places application instinctively led towards important question instead requiring special syntax selectors local default global selectors opt-in exception could write instead backdrop root_isCollapsed backdrop field field focus selectors would normally vague transforming css-loader local scope format would eliminate issue ensure remain scoped module used cases couldn avoid global styles could explicitly mark special global syntax example styling un-scoped classes generated ReactCSSTransitionGroup panel global transition-active-enter case re scoping local panel identifier module re also styling global class outside control started investigating might implement local-by-default class syntax realised wouldn difficult achieve leveraged PostCSS fantastic tool allows write custom CSS transformers plugins One popular CSS build tools today Autoprefixer actually PostCSS plugin doubles standalone tool formalise usage local CSS ve open sourced highlyexperimental plugin PostCSS called postcss-local-scope still heavy development use production risk re using Webpack relatively straightforward process hook postcss-loader postcss-local-scope CSS build process Rather document ve created example repository postcss-local-scope-example shows small working example Excitingly introducing local scope really beginning Letting build tool handle generation class names potentially huge implications long term could decide stop human compilers let computer optimise output future could start generating shared classes components automatically treating style re-use optimisation compile time ve tried working local CSS really going back Experiencing true local scope style sheets way works across browsers something easily ignored Introducing local scope significant ripple effect approach CSS Naming conventions patterns re-use potential extraction styles separate packages directly affected shift re beginning new era local CSS Understanding ramifications shift something re still working valuable input experimentation m hoping conversation together larger community get involved make sure see eyes bychecking postcss-local-scope-example ve seen action think ll agree hyperbole days global CSS coming end future CSS local Note Automatically optimising style re-use components would amazing step forward definitely requires help people lot smarter Hopefully come Addendum24 May 2015 original ideas presented

relevant year might hold much weight years important append timestamps content display timestamps right format users could trouble using Absolute vs Relative TimestampsThere two types timestamps sites use Relative timestamps display number minutes hours days weeks years ago post published Absolute timestamps display exact date time post published formats offer utility different ways use one display factors determine whether timestamps usable Use Absolute TimestampsThere times users need look back past content retrieve information Without absolute timestamps users target specific period find information Sites host photos documents messages tasks events need absolute timestamps content hold utility future users need reference Use absolute timestamps users go back make use past content Friendly FormattingThe benefit absolute timestamps relative ones offer precise date time dates times hard interpret users live timezone country important display absolute timestamps friendly format Converting TimezonesA problem absolute timestamps force users convert timezones get local time frustrate live timezone server Users able get right time without making calculations errors Imagine user attending event doesn notice change timezone makes mistake converting user would end missing event could lead unfortunate consequences contexts like important absolute timestamps timezone friendly way optimize code detects displays user local timezone instead server Start storing timestamps UTC server UTC universal standard affected daylight savings time display user local time need user timezone offset add database UTC value get user timezone offset auto-detecting Javascript Timezone Function Converting 24-hour Clock TimesIf users around world use type clock force convert times clock use english-speaking countries use 12-hour clock dominant written spoken system time countries use 12-hour clock spoken time 24-hour clock written notation people 24-hour countries used systems problem switching two source display times 12-hour clock default many users prefer 24-hour clock could display 24-hour time link icon tooltip opens mouse hover Reading Numeric Date FormatsTime formats aren issue users face reading absolute timestamp Dates also give users trouble re displayed numeric format Different countries interpret numeric dates different order put day number first put month number first put year first Figuring taxing cognitive resources lead user error Avoid confusing users using written date format timestamp Write month name full abbreviated form abbreviate year abbreviated year cause confusion day number display formatted dates different countries Javascript Date Library Use Absolute TimestampsYou may deal formatting issues even need use absolute timestamp Sometimes relative timestamp better fit site content updates often lot user activity use relative timestamps Sites publish news forums users post links comments need show immediacy allows users stay up-to-date new information comes Use Relative TimestampsAccuracy isn important relative timestamps immediacy users want know long ago site published post prefer time units written form way mentally calculate dates times count back present day users convert time zones relative timestamps Content published hour ago five hours ago makes difference users need general sense recency Friendly FormattingThere formatting issues relative timestamps know Unlike absolute timestamp issues deal interpretation deal mental work Adaptive Time UnitsThe trouble relative timestamps start time unit format doesn adapt duration Instead displays small subset time units example site may display relative timestamps minutes hours days days doesn display time units follow Users get frustrated trying calculate number days hundreds relative timestamp always adapt duration display time units accordingly 30 days display months 12 months display years Precise Time UnitsIf site doesn display content order submission users

('Considerations on Bug Reporting in Teams', "Treehouse Grow CSS skills Land dream job Blog Videos Almanac Snippets Forums Jobs Lodge Search Considerations Bug Reporting Teams Published May 19 2015 Robin Rendle Here's frustrating situation someone notices real layout bug glitch kind fail accurately describe problem tell front-end developers all-round good team players it's responsibility establish workflow reporting cataloguing describing bugs people likely encounter system bug reports team environment ton benefits Knowing bugs currently exist Understand working need Get overview much time take get things done Find tasks blocked require kind dependency they're tackled first step pick tool everyone feels comfortable solid bug-fixing system place we're much better position great work yet it's important note good bug-reporting skills requirement developers Everyone team capable finding bug providing much information possible means designers developers project managers experience levels shouldn't afraid use bug tool get overview project whole I've always found Trello personal favourite makes lot sense rest team doesn't necessarily mean it's best particular use-case popular bug-tracking tools services worth checking Trello Stack Sifter Waffle Basecamp JIRA GitHub Issues Asana BugHerd Regardless tool pick end need ensure everyone happy proposed workflow since we'll need everyone's help documenting recording scouring project potential bugs unhelpful bug report Even pick perfect tool doesn't necessarily mean used everyone helpful manner plenty instances I've struggled find reported bug lack information that's available helpful list style broken IE scrolling across page weird glitches fact types comments almost useless developer aren't specific enough Developers would much prefer bug report contained info helpful bug report Although completely dependent particular case hand would best read something along lines special list style Contact page positioned incorrectly left side container Firefox IE11 Please see attached image info developer immediately find bug question begin devise proper solution problem help everyone else team write great bug reports I've found immensely helpful sit everyone team beginning project outline detail work says bug fixed reviews particular bit code automated tools use find bugs assets need design team find one important questions lead frustrating problems they're left unanswered I've come quick list items expect bug reports 1 short point don't jerk Ideally want bullet points rather long sentences developer find issue quickly although doesn't give us excuse curt It's best describe problem accurately deterrents possible someone built particular feature knows in-and-outs perhaps assign first don't put blame 2 Make sure add screenshots GIFs animation complex interaction bugs particular animated GIFs almost essential highlighting flaw's peculiarities However part simple screenshot help us find view template bug found Animated GIF grabbing tools GifGrabber PicGIF LICEcap Screenshot GIF Video Cloud Storage tools Droplr CloudApp Screenr don't forget GitHub issues drag drop screenshots 3 Identify browser version It's helpful simply quote name browser like Chrome IE it's much better give particular browser version Chrome 42 IE8 also figure whether bug isn't present browsers that's even better something like found bug iOS 8 3 can't replicate Webkit browser sort information might save developer lot time quickly identify what's going wrong want make sure send along possible information could use tool like Support Details snags lot stuff allows email PDF screenshot include bug reporting control even grab prefill hidden fields information without effort reporter 4 Make note template view page bug found it's blog contact-us page found specific partial header footer let developer know quickly possible full URL usually super helpful 5 Don't forget mention particular module class might causing issue you're familiar front-end want give developer answer problem you'll need two things First you'll need collect high-five every developer team reporting bugs whilst simultaneously telling developer fix big deal secondly you'll probably need make reduced test case involves breaking code little chunks picking away reveal precisely that's going information you'll honing section problematic code making everyone's lives little bit easier 6 See console errors notifications Rather copy pasting console error it's probably best take screenshot there's warnings might unrelated particular bug you've found might thing that's messing everything 7 Double check bug already found someone else Duplicating bug reports generally hasn't much problem projects I've worked lots issues it's definitely worth taking quick glance archived bugs currently open issues see bug found task might also involve going seeing bugs similar tagging problem app use bug found maybe it's worth adding information noting card found new instance problem 8 Group tasks specific categories I've found particularly useful marking issue 'blocked' using labels feature Trello big red tag let everyone know there's another problem associated task must dealt first Similarly it's helpful separate everyone's tasks specific areas Content Design Front-end Integration Back-end Bugs Code Review Done gives us overview project timeline gives developers opportunity look bugs single glance bug-reporting software ability classify things Tagging categorizing labeling assigning whatever 9 Document existing bug task workflow feel great workflow place perhaps setup document covers process little detail might organization might help others don't make mistakes Two references come mind Thoughtbot playbook Harry Roberts' post Trello workflow Wrapping I've always felt list bugs shouldn't daunting over-whelming pressure burdens everyone team desire fight bicker Instead bug list inspire us roll sleeves encourage us help whatever way spend little time figuring tiny details process perhaps shed burdens continue build great things web bug-review process look like tools find useful Add comment I'll sure update post future reference

tools lack great user experience great bug tracking tools nowadays makes process fun take Usersnap https usersnap com example adds information like screen resolution browser version installed plugin automatically every bug report Regarding 6 console recorder truly recommend check console recorder Usersnap https usersnap com features console-recorder great productivity booster since automatically adds client-side javascript errors xhr logs every bug report Reply Lewis Cowles Lewiscowles1 Permalink comment May 20 2015 Great internal bug report someone might info available time skills knowledge vary amongst team Instead would encourage SW devs try automate much possible e browser used make bug report easily retrievable URL mentioned also doozie view file developer include bug reporting tooling request data etc trying get across easy QA maybe SW Dev smaller enterprises ask someone give info usually frustrates however nice put even intention especially file bug report ignorant internal systems architecture might even try helpful guessing might causing problem send back problem SW Dev ve fair share wasted time looking poor bug reports business owner also know sometimes people get lazy lack skills access report everything helpful way Sometimes get someone fit specific workflow lazy rather learn potentially easier way involved mind 12 years professional experience think suggestion building bug reporting SW automating much possible good idea help situations Also reading bug report ve noticed lot quick responses people miss things oh X problem CSS issue actually could artefact poor CSS choices internal peice SW using X get back Holiday instituting deliberate inefficiencies business QA support actually support process place help user bonus helps business well

workflow needs change Workflow overhead destroying soul Advice Sorry wall text I'm bind I'm looking better workflow possible pricing advice company work Building bespoke WP themes websites killing love making websites lately due insane workload overhead I'm dealing backdrop information I'm web designer company Trying convince boss hire another one can't afford moment currently huge workload needs get door Certain clients see need get good idea maybe need within 20 hours even Wordpress occasions feel pass better part week two single projects intersped code projects time naturally - oh work currently low hourly rate 2700 - 3330 taxes per month unless make sale get keep provision sum increases naturally ofcourse write alot code it's hard cold sales time Full disclosure Right 12-15 outstanding projects needs come rack get delivered quickly 1 5 month simple mind others complicated terms code needs applied Also 10 barely touched even mockup phase Sale process pricing don't sell websites sales team currently we've reduced team one selling websites amount work already also sell various Google products sales person take cut price sales make charge roughly 1000 USD small website 3'ish pages contact form medium website CMS Wordpress far 2111 USD bespoke theme designed ground process described larger website also CMS WP 4000 USD includes advanced functions dont webshops cause workload would destroy soul simple project managment use Podio base client information details regarding ongoing completed projects along sales included Technically I'm one really uses read mine workflow work Windows tools Sublime Text 3 Adobe CC Mostly use Bootstrap goto framework goto-CMS Wordpress Mocking locally Wordpressing server upload via FileZilla I'm proficient HTML CSS jquery base Javascript PHP I've picked years means comes front end things tools Wordpress custom post types plugins unless find awfully bloated read usually build bespoke themes due rather large bloat commercial free themes repository themeforest Also knowing code themes SEO benefits read huge flaws spend hours either cutting code functions wouldn't work us situation atleast almost big job building ground way work days goes something like client fetch mockup startup folder made includes base Hello world base Bootstrap framework nav meta tags CSS libraries like animate css wow js certain reuseable code always get used one way another - modify match whatever build start mocking home page landing page project find something works base responsive testing coding show layout client come feedback either iterate changes change completly missed mark certain elements things see used often projects fetch modify quicken mockup phase get past part usually means client signed design mockup start building content pages put CMS Wordpress case mockup phase move entire project base Wordpress setup I've mirrored used tools frameworks like mockup start building site Usually goes quickly seeing it's essentially quick splitting mockup 3 parts header php footer php home php building pages sidebars custom post types contact forms applicable moving content requesting finishing project Depending client phase take long go really quickly point need mobile testing mediaqueries alter content images CSS mobile tablets viewports general also long tedious task Also - Make quick note nowhere mentioned SEO stuff yet also technically something deal aswell way build show client development server max 5 databases it's slow response time upload via FTP every single file update bad also advice developement hosting spin projects get started quickly also collecting files common themes see used time also means someone else build content work design another site I'm still limited 5 sites time ofcourse eliminated simply changing host suppose feel disclosed well I'm sure you've caught grew webdesign 15 years ago clue operate command line examples workflow vids I've seen read also dont version check Client type examples We've clients need like 3-5 pages it's done quickly cause perfect idea fit perfectly brand area expertise we've client needed amount get stuck iteration-hell keep changing large parts code fit clients expections we've clients we've pushed simplest code bare neccessities MVP focused content Either way feel we've approached different types clients expections general projects take time single developer deliver Hell dedicated sales person probably sell atleast one website day feel lets say like 1 every day still like 10 websites month I'm looking advice mentoring web folks managing workload Possible even someone would like talk Skype similar would awesome I'd love see peoples workflows even get help setting something reusable Show go - Z project - works guys doesn't work typical web project get Z much time use typical client price projects general Also get talk someone probably clarify clearly work Writing hard sigh I'd love way spinning new project dropping standard database random placeholder content functioning contact forms base pages - functioning Wordpress whatever could work simply box get content building quicker Preferable one click command preferably something hosted get client quicker show build content get involved dev process workflow teambased I'm webdesigner also problematic cause one cant delegate certain stages developement want get B quicker naturally feel workflow killing profits mine despite hourly rate - importantly - can't solve get done quicker hope hiring another developer designer isn't happening time soon stuck slow tedious workflow ofcourse said sometimes get perfect storm idea client everything falls place perfectly client gets happy get happy done quickly know plan survives first contact enemy client hell want tell suck - feel free - still would like constructive help feedback don't know start Convincing explaining time cost boss founder sales person b cares bottom line difficult

hidden-target elements unique IDs act targets carousel items controls div carousel-item elements hold content carousel items div carousel-item elements content within two links arrow-prev arrow-next use cycle carousel items individual carousel items position absolute stack top eachother set div carousel-wrapper height manually makes sense inline re going try offload much CSS external stylesheet items ll write inline order make carousel reusable scalable m also using inline CSS set background image two div carousel-item elements make little vibrant ll leave markup readable --Here's main wrapper Since carousel items get size parent specify height -- div class carousel-wrapper style height 400px --The carousel uses regular links cycle item links actually target display none spans page doesn't jump like normally would using jump links -- span id target-item-1 span span id target-item-2 span span id target-item-3 span --Here carousel items 'carousel-item' class use shared styling

fade cycle using arrow links carousel-item position absolute top 0 bottom 0 left 0 right 0 padding 25px 50px opacity 0 transition 0 5s ease-in-out notice 50px left right padding It's position arrow links one 50px wide Also I'm using empty links background image links look like arrows Make sure swap URL actual URL arrow links aren't transparent rectangles arrow position absolute top 0 display block width 50px height 100 -webkit-tap-highlight-color rgba 0 0 0 0 background url carousel-arrow-dark png 50 50 20px no-repeat Let's put arrow go back left arrow-prev left 0 arrow go forward right Since I'm using arrow image arrows I'm rotating one 180 degrees points right direction arrow-next right 0 -webkit-transform rotate 180deg transform rotate 180deg really like carousel items look dark image background carousel-item div class 'light' we'll make text color white use white arrow instad dark gray one make sure arrow image exists somewhere light color white arrow background url carousel-arrow-light png 50 50 20px no-repeat Let's use using media queries resize arrows smaller devices media max-width 480px arrow light arrow background-size 10px background-position 10px 50 Let's set jump link targets display none we're making browser jump top carousel whenever user clicks one arrow links attribute selector target element whose id starts 'target-item' id target-item display none made carousel items transparent means page-load we'd big empty box carousel Let's set first item's opacity 1 displays instead Also we're setting z-index 2 it's positioned top carousel items item-1 z-index 2 opacity 1 don't want first item ALAWYS opacity 1 otherwise would peek cycling items two target item-1 opacity 0 target-item-1 targeted well want first item show we're selecting sibling selector setting opacity 1 - target-item-1 target item-1 opacity 1 target-item- targeted let's select using sibling selector make fade place top pile using z-index 3 Here's you'd add target items carousel three items might worth adding like 10 items right bat target-item-2 target item-2 target-item-3 target item-3 z-index 3 opacity 1 carousel fully functional 100 HTML CSS made carousel

('Nesting Components', "simurai UI Designer CSS Doodler Projects Lab Blog Nesting Components May 11 2015 struggles contextual styling Using CSS components somewhat straightforward add markup give component class name good gets trickier try nest components need tweaked based context styles defined question ve asking times article trying explore clarify start CSS components mean small building blocks get used assemble website app Like buttons inputs navs headers etc also call modules patterns Also I'm using SUIT naming convention examples convention would fine well heads isn't awesome solution end solves problems It's whining time Ok best go straight look example Let say Header component would like add Button component inside header class Header button class Button Button button header Button inside Header want make Button bit smaller would approaches Option 1 - Descendant selector Maybe common way use descendant selector change font-size whenever Button inside Header Header Button font-size 75em works great question rule added probably split components separate files header scss button scss words Header know components might get nested Button know environment get placed wait point creating components separate make modular component kept isolated shouldn know components make changes rename remove without check might get used somewhere else Option 2 - Variations Another way create variations add Button--small class use whenever would like button smaller without worry ancestors Button--small font-size 75em header class Header button class Button Button--small Button button header works great could get hand quickly point want font-size 9em Create yet another variation Button--justALittleSmaller project keeps growing number variations start loose sight actually get used re sure anymore change variation side effects place could create contextual variations like Button--header Button--footer re back beginning could well use descendant selectors goes using states Button is-small used change state fit certain context Option 3 - Adopted Child remember read approach somehow stuck also forgot called ll call Adopted Child Let switch around look Header perspective would wouldn know components called might get nested know want make bit smaller Well probably would create generic Header-item class use like Header-item font-size 75em header class Header div class Header-item div header Ok gets us bit closer probably strange saying like talking CSS would want create child still one Right could adopt one example adopt Button component child didn create tweak erm mean raise like born button scss Button font-size 1em raised header css Header Header-item font-size 75em header class Header button class Header-item Button Button button header bit uncommon HTML element shares classes two different components without risks later really like approach keeps components independent without know Another nice thing want add components Header also need adjustments reuse Header-item class like example text Input header class Header input class Header-item Input button class Header-item Button Button button header Ok risks Well depending properties wanna change might always ideal example Button already font-size defined increase specificity using Header Header-item would also override variations like Button--small might want also situations d like variation always stronger example would changing colors color Buttons different inside Header variation like Button primary Yeah could take look inside button scss style-guide remember goal actually want make decisions looking components made general rule use adopted children properties theme related sure want override time Like layout size related properties adjusting position options ways contextual styling came mind I'll mention briefly completeness think 3 better suited Option 4 - could use preprocessor extend existing component example would clone Button tweaks added used new child component Header-button rely Button exists source don't worry contexts Downside inflating CSS output well remember lots new child component classes Option 5 - could create utility class like u-small It's similar variations scoped single component could used components well reason becomes risky ever change later Option 6 - course could use inline styles would leave JavaScript best m afraid isn't clear winner would nice keep consistent single approach throughout entire project guess decide per case basis Descendant selectors expect components change much Like using UI Kit library Variations makes sense component different versions get reused anyways specific context Adopted Child layout sizing positioning sure always want override property Also changing multiple child components Extending truly want components separated mind inflating CSS output Utilities specific things class defined never change like clearing floats Inline styles needs dynamically added JavaScript said beginning haven't found fits solution maybe conclusion Try keep contextual styling minimum Updates Adopted Child approach called Mixes BEM infos SUIT also recommends using Adopted Child Mixes also another option Option 7 - Adding wrapper element It's div class Excerpt-wrapButton example think works great cases example using Flexbox parent child relationship adding extra wrapper would break might still need set width wrapped component 100 Anyways great addition Thanks Pablo comments Option 8 - Single Purpose Classes It's every class single property It's somewhere utilities Option 5 inline styles Option 6 Atomic CSS Tachyons use approach haven't used real project looking concerns similar ones utilites want change value SP class seems unpredictable another place class used might want keep current value would first check change unwanted effects somewhere else Please enable JavaScript view comments powered Disqus comments powered Disqus FrontLinks Filtering photo filters Spacing elements Styling STRINGS BEM syntax UX mind Sizing Web components Sprite sheet animation steps Flexible Web Apps Flick Scrolling Media Query splitting SVG Stacks re icon-sharpness limbo Another angle skeuomorphs Force scrollbar back flirts CSS3 new design process Projects Lab Blog"),

Bourbon Neat gives way use grid structure web page happy look widely adopted grid systems Bootstrap Foundation 960 Grid System Skeleton inherent problem standard way used Problem Presentation ClassesEach systems involve applying classes elements markup look something like section id content class row article class small-12 medium-10 large-8 columns h1 h1 p p article aside class small-12 medium-2 large-4 columns aside section means want adjust content displayed change markup Keeping things belongWhen HTML describing something looks Something broken Content Layer content able understood independent rules looks ends rendered HTML could start number different forms JSON XML markdown etc Presentation Layer hard talk separation content presentation without going back CSS Zen Garden beautiful demonstration CSS role providing home presentation content resides markup Behavior Layer stuff happens based events Generally speaking javascript home maintaining lines separation re positioning better workflow someone responsible layout style content page needs work CSS project able apply column spans grid system elements project CSS rather HTML elimate need darn presentation classes could look something like section id content article h1 h1 p p article aside aside section Ahhhh doesn feel nice markup semantically telling us content nothing get effect grid system without junking HTML Bourbon Neat comes Bourbon Neat Neat set SASS mixins build top Bourbon builds top SASS gives us ability apply column spans SASS outputted compiled CSS Thus giving end result functioning

isn say plugins aren well made best CMS plugins know actually actually WordPress anyway MVC Based Nope deal breaker Absolutely used think without clear MVC structure CMS worth doesn MVC structure actually lot things free form allow greater errors variations implementations also doesn follow normal structure d come expect modern code said WP one best documented CMSes docs make lack MVC structure Documentation Theme Development Probably best documentation CMS ever made many folks use many folks support thus documentation awesome number answers offered StackOverflow small either problem someone already asked question 50 times online answers floating around Community Support stated last section also great sheer number folks used contributed WordPress remarkable Packaged installable via composer really packaged via composer Well kind post define VCS composer use WP composer https davidwinter install-and-manage-wordpress-with-composer said wouldn really want since

Everyone Developers F K stores important configuration information part MySQL DB lunacy Joomla Introduction Joomla really need introduction around decade almost half first MVC based PHP CMS neck neck WP 2 years ago page re interested Additional Post Types Custom Fields Nope natively ll need install extension make happen Joomla article system relatively weak unless install plugins top holds true Custom Extra fields articles well ve previously written article comparing many Joomla CCK content creation kit options ve personally used K2 extensively vouch said K2 ability create new post type ll create category represents post type use Coming WordPress Joomla definitely seem rigid ve heard lot good things Flexicontent adds flexible content types fields categories Plugin Availability lot plugins like WordPress lot suck ve written article previously favorites said good plugins either completely commercial freemium additional plugins within plugins really issue see detractor many folks MVC Based Yes Joomla nice MVC structure two structures hold administrative portion code front facing portion code like would imagine making CI Laravel app certain extent said weird Joomla things probably know take full advantage software Also Joomla three ways extend system Plugins Modules Components Plugins smallest piece usually used make content modifications small changes CSS minification parsing email make links etc Modules like widgets WordPress except lot logic built re often times easiest ways display custom content client Components full MVC based apps co-exists core Joomla systems CCK SEO systems backup systems etc Documentation Theme Development Documentation used suck doesn documentation similar level WordPress smaller size community apparent pages theme development docs pretty well laid imagine many issues finding right answers docs doesn work plethora answers StackOverflow Joomla Forums would say though component development page thorough lot things ve seem https docs joomla org J3 x Developing_a_MVC_Component d say in-depth WordPress plugin page https codex wordpress org Writing_a_Plugin said Joomla complex WordPress Community Support Stackoverflow 5 times less questions tagged Joomla WordPress indicator said entire portion Joomla org dedicated community growth Packaged Yes Joomla framework installed via composer Since CMS portion code fully refactored re-written top framework realistically answer Future Joomla MVC based CMS fundamentally superior WordPress many systems said Joomla isn easiest learn use CMSes losing CMS type systems m sure leads refactor CMS framework capture new developer interest could hit course assumes things like OctoberCMS runs top popular fun Laravel Framework doesn take Joomla 60 Developer 20 Designer 20 End-User Joomla still needs lot work really catch October CMS Introduction October CMS written top popular Laravel framework familiar Laravel based system structure top CMS tries go back basics simple good static HTML pages without losing nice bits CMSes introduced logic data storage introduced developer fact liked much m rebuilding personal website using October right Obvious bias apply October since built top fav Laravel Additional Post Types Custom Fields m sure really say section since October come post type custom fields concept concept user control HTML Content maximum amount Unless write HTML CMS least right no-frills approach fresh makes want use personal projects Plugin Availability short-ish list plugins free paid 120 seem relative quality ve seen far Rainlab plugins seem well made re creators October Since ve much use plugins really comment much October small collection paid apps shop testimonials event coordination catalogs pretty good considering size community Awesome stuff MVC Based Absolutely Laravel based system really attractive MVC style Plugins allows quick patterned plugin development clearly laid structure main developer plugins almost need docs top completely MVC based October uses latest greatest PHP programming concepts code object-oriented way keeps things clean Laravel concepts learned seem directly applying many cases October extends Laravel classes methods part Documentation Theme Development documentation shows use file structures assets within october https octobercms com docs cms themes template structure awesome allows even define function top pre-defined hooks like onStart write process information like might WordPress template Nice Also October goes beyond CMSes comes pre-made AJAX interface https octobercms com docs cms ajax essentially make asynchronous form without much work Community Support StackOverflow 30 questions October October forums lot posts lot answers https octobercms com forum honest many issues ve m secretly writing plugin CMS happens mostly solved example blog entry system rest near Laravel m used anyway Packaged October system installable via composer CMS actually purely installable via composer plugins packaged installable backend much like WordPress Generally speaking thing want CMS packaged modern day Future number plugins clean MVC layout would much prefer developing Laravel based OctoberCMS another system PS m super sold Laravel Also delight 24th April released full-fledged Media-Manager make blogging lot easier port Joomla 2 5 personal blog OctoberCMS October Developers Developers Developers Yup think make look good built nerds Bolt CM Introduction Bolt trying really hard WP login instantly see resemblance pretty much similarities end lot closer OctoberCMS terms build said Bolt seems aim directly WP Additional Post Types Custom Fields Damn like WordPress built correctly work Content Types Taxonomies YAML file Configuration intuitive beautiful said know re building customer wants content management system built correctly obviously case WP made fault WP system isn user friendly ACF WordPress repeater fields system doesn exist Bolt CM despite beautiful YAML based configuration file kind deal breaker us Plugin Availability kind surprised good way look plugin availability Bolt good even compared October CMS extension library doesn seem paid app section may detractor lot developers would hard get except bare-bones informational website Let know m wrong missed something MVC Based Well based Silex micro-framework system uses Silex routing controllers Doctrine model Twig template renderer like Laravel Illuminate Routing Controller controller router Eloquent model Blade template renderer pretty similar ways directly affect way template theme development happen like Joomla Nope think beauty Bolt Instead mapping things directly code allows specify via YAML route URL dynamic URL path controller contenttype set way get right URL structure functionality view Documentation Theme Development Documentation fantastic think whoever idea CMS wrote clear Bolt CM built intent manifesto part Docs clear mean docs lays templating extension creation nicely ve time really dive either m sure hard said Twig easier PHP template layout near identical WP actually template hierarchy better WP since definable tee YAML Content type Community Support Bolt 120 questions answered StackOverflow seem forum unlike October Packaged installation done GIT zip fies Bolt uses standard Composer phar based package management Future Bolt seems active development Github growing user base though m sure many Bolt like Bolt manifesto giving End-Users Frontend-Devs Backend-Devs equal priority works m often really annoyed things balance PageKit Introduction PageKit made YooThemes YooThemse builds themes components Joomla WordPress Since work lot top two installed CMSes pretty clear probably know going ve reviewed ZOO CCK Joomla pretty awesome Additional Post Types Custom Fields things appear works Obviously getting easy fast said widget system already built think Widget idea important idea YooThemes one primary ways many themes packaged want sell theme Joomla WP PageKit Widgets probably really important one Plugin Availability really didn see much way plugin ll see plan place Market Place within CMS one click installs MVC Based Yup Using lot Symphony components likes everyone else built similar Bolt except instead Silex YooThemes uses PageKit Framework Documentation Theme Development Documentation isn looks works custom fields taxonomies said already pagekit command use generator theme command used create scaffold extensions pretty amazing project early Community Support since early effort hard say m sure right time judge PageKit support Packaged initially hard time installing one pulled branch github rather buggy m sure re working Might pulled develop instead master register website get 0 8 8 version software application relies composer newer build looks like bower system isn installable via package manager Future Roadmap shows many things including http www pagekit com roadmap Custom Fields Front end editing Revisions Taxonomies Multi-lingual capabilities Whos PageKit Unfortunately right Alpha stage unless test absolute personal whatever project one Hopefully YooThemes build commercially viable reliable PHP CMS soon ProcessWire Introduction one ve always looked alternative used CMS WordPress Wordpress really works well ACF Pods ProcessWire fields built start Additional Post Types Custom Fields Process Wire built custom fields even repeater fields said isn way custom post type Instead relies lot page tree system create listings wanted pull list child elements actually pretty easy foreach page- children child echo child- title endforeach things figured Also ability distinguish pages building new pages new template Templates assigned specific fields addition repeater fields child pages Profields system paid addon comes multiplier fields lot closer functionality ACF repeaters open source way make money right Plugin Availability first party plugins 90 250 dollars seems offer functionality get ACF Gravity Forms money third party plugins modules available also hard browse understand without spending time ve really chance play part MVC Based quite got thing going m sure core files dumped single core folder contains everything logic related kind like system32 folder Windows use concept controllers stuff exactly classic MVC might thinking Everything object oriented Documentation Theme Development lead developer wrote really nice sets tutorials templating well aspects build Community Support community seems pretty large active comments forums seems rather insular aren many questions answers outside forums Packaged like WordPress zipped less Future re working continuously improving things lead dev seems really charge seems lead folks clear advantages singular goal similar direction Check road map https processwire com roadmap Whos ProcessWire ProcessWire definitely open source use greater level might need pay lot get ProcessWire commercial pay feature get done kind system similar lines PyroCMS ExpressionEngine operational cost said PW doesn use standard PHP components Symphony Doctrine Laravel Silex etc set rules without composer exactly wanted said according roadmap ll soon changing Version 3 0 PyroCMS Introduction PyroCMS nicely built CMS built trusty CodeIgniter old friend commercial paid version support extra functionality Additional Post Types Custom Fields supports adding page post types well assigning custom fields repeater functionality makes ACF great re working called Grid field type Hopefully completed soon Plugin Availability quite add ons 200 including themes reminded bit JED Joomla Extensions Directory nothing seemed really stand much truth core well thought enough really need much add ons system even comes forms system MVC Based Written top CodeIgniter system definitely MVC Actually HMVC Hierarchical MVC stores modules within CMS Documentation Theme Development good amount documentation theme creation templating easy well documented also developer documentation module plugin field type development great examples Community Support 370 topics relating PyroCMS quite bit Forums Pyro website ton topics folks talking m starting like thing Packaged Pyro started time composer composer Sparks Codeigniter modules similar concepts autoload PHP code Spark Modules main system ve used Composer came quickly Sparks Yes antiquated Future PyroCMS isn standing around hoping continue CodeIgniter CI also pretty much got dumped parent Ellislabs re porting entire application top Laravel looking forward Yes Whos PyroCMS kind strange time answering question PyroCMS great someone doesn want WordPress slightly technical skills One note PyroCMS v3 0 want PyroCMS 3 0 fully baked cake oven would ready build something top jumped ship CI Laravel Composer year ago never looked back hope PyroCMS CMS finally kill WordPress Conclusion learned wanted CMS list things wanted see criteria Ability assign new Pages Posts Type Ability create Custom Fields Repeatable Custom Fields Decent Plugin availability want make sure least way CMS things client requirement change Based good MVC framework prefer Laravel otherwise Good Documentation though secondary feature sets read code examples Good Community insular questions forums also outside places like StackOverflow Packaged using managed system aka Composer Forward thinking potential growth beyond current iteration built Users Designers Developers see saw lot CMSes lot potential still baked oven others around decade m obviously biased ll tell think list PHP based CMSes order would consider production use right based review WordPress PyroCMS Joomla ProcessWire Bolt cm OctoberCMS PageKit PageKit last ready prime time definitely still gooey cake OctoberCMS cool definitely light-hearted aka clients barely type email Bolt cm lacked lot functionality would consider required based trying ProcessWire pretty cool m sure enough really consider using especially since guts single folder Everything looks cool front-end irked little bit know re probably thinking namespaced anyway Joomla old friend still isn easy user grasp backend concepts know experience PyroCMS might give try production scenario kind want wait Laravel foundation though really want support two non-backwards compatible versions CMS single client ve already Joomla ain pretty WordPress false king CMS Stores configs SQL core MVC using package management like rest PHP object oriented etc technical reasons use WordPress big support community plugins documentation bigger like Windows PHP CMS world everything need know fall short Hopefully one day soon CMS modern code base works everyone appreciate WordPress ll need replace sooner rather

dozen websites small mom pop shops using WordPress never charged lot simply enjoyed writing copy taking pictures making creative design decisions without focusing much custom HTML CSS comes disclaimer m web developer never claimed WordPress great option Content Management System CMS advertise something like 19 websites Internet use WordPress nearly 75 million websites worldwide However growing number new er players market Joomla Wix Weebly SquareSpace name couple favorite podcasts Hello Internet 99 Invisible sponsored SquareSpace heard easy create beautiful website finally gave latest website rebuild experimented see Squarespace really easy advertised not-a-web-developer First Using WordPress went pretty normal route Purchase domain name somewhere 10 year bought hosting somewhere 6-12 month tried several years various reasons loaded WordPress hosting site find theme went Themeforest try find theme matched customer expectations close possible purchased theme 50 installed WordPress finally ready build content 20-30 hours work website would completely running pictures content contact pages galleries etc mostly painless things worked way would expect Lots Googling forums watching videos reading documentation However areas really painful example 1 Different implementations Every theme would implement things differently enough really annoy Widgets menus plugins themes require certain plugins sliders galleries etc standardization WordPress fine creating one-off website business becomes bit unwieldy websites put together 2 Plugins many plugins tried avoid possible sometimes needed extra functionality Unless wanted write code looking plugin Plugins need testing need periodic updating Like things moving parts likely something break said great WordPress offers many plugins 33 776 moment Nearly anything accomplished customer asked connect so-and-so bank shopping cart could almost always least say possible Truly double-edged sword 3 Updates Everything needs updating WordPress needs updating theme needs updating Plugins need updating Sometimes WordPress updating break plugin need scramble fix 4 Support Support every direction never guarantee hosting company offered chat would probably least hour Theme support entirely unpredictable never know developer theme going decide stop updating theme stop matter time WordPress update breaks something scary world not-a-web-developer something breaks re reduced 5 Hacks Oh hacking Many times plugin theme layout wasn quite looking Hack Fortunately huge WordPress community graciously help tell hack way right design careful hack certain way ll break update last point brings decided try Squarespace made mistake first website WordPress purchased theme wasn well liked masses unpopular Unfortunately naivety didn think theme perfect layout colors design close wanted non-profit nature park perfect theme get feet wet said done quite proud site functional clean naturesque 3 years theme developer completely dipped Things started break Plugins necessary theme longer supported ship sinking spending much time patching leaks especially pro-bono work needed something less time consuming needed something like Squarespace Switching Squarespace Squarespace tiny player market comparison WordPress claim million websites created nowhere near WordPress 75 million However Apple-esque mentality closed source gated

('3 Automatic and Useful Sass Snippets', "H 5 Useful Sass Snippets Article 5 Useful Sass Snippets Automating annoying systems Table Contents Article Info Article 5 May 8 2015 One thing absolutely love Sass mixins functions able automate many repetitive coding CSS amazing building maintaining base often find many developers creating complex systems simple tasks managing font stack color scheme tedious set employ article explain automate systems remember Colors site's color scheme important Typically see lot series variables represent scheme find effective maybe it's never seem kept kind systems straight utilizing code Let's say five colors red red-yellow yellow tan brown know you're thinking Hmphry seriously can't remember 5 color values small color scheme unlikely practice multiple reds red-2 five different reds Instead like use function called color know creative color typically takes 3 parameter color shade transparency sweet RGBA action color-stack group orange id normal color e67835 group orange id pale color f8a878 group orange id dark color ad490c group blue id normal color 426682 Color Function function color group shade normal transparency 1 color color-stack c-group map-get color group c-shade map-get color id group map-get color group shade map-get color id return rgba map-get color color transparency explain bit going Sass map called color-stack thing ever update add remove color strong EVER strong map three identifiers code class language-scss group code class language-scss id code class language-scss color Group Group want called instance orange blue even something silly like Megatron field unique color ID color's unique identifier pale orange would 'pale' Megatron's steel would 'steel' Normal default entry it's good idea keep id default marked 'normal' field unique group repeat group Color put hex color called function loop color-stack finds match group id adjust transparency Using pretty simple body color color blue normal 8 p color color orange blockquote color color blue background color orange pale 4 border-color color orange dark compiles body color rgba 66 102 130 0 8 p color e67835 blockquote color 426682 background rgba 248 168 120 0 4 border-color ad490c Update common question function don't use c- It's good question reason use color it's system accustomed Writing color easier c- whatever reason also like general name descriptor name separate Truthfully use variable system mine you're going miss much long keep color names simple descriptive organized Font Stack font stack another one problems often solved variables instance makes lot sense easy enough work Weird problems arise use third party services however instance fonts com handles stack weird default wierd Well let's say want want entire family Brandon Grotesque awesome website Well call weight 200 it'd font-family 'Brandon Grot W01 Light' 700 font-family 'Brandon Grot W01 Bold' See problem Especially add fonts mix Fret devised simple mixin font-stack group brandon id light font 'Brandon Grot W01 Light' san-serif weight 200 style normal group brandon id light-italic font 'Brandon Grot W01 Light' san-serif weight 200 style italic group brandon id regular font 'Brandon Grot W01-Regular' san-serif weight 400 style normal group brandon id regular-italic font 'Brandon Grot W01-Regular' san-serif weight 400 style italic group brandon id bold font 'Brandon Grot W01 Black' san-serif weight 700 style normal group brandon id bold-italic font 'Brandon Grot W01-Regular' san-serif weight 400 style italic group clarendon id regular font 'Clarendon LT W01' serif weight 200 style normal group code id regular font monospace weight 400 style normal Breakpoint Mixin mixin font group id regular font font-stack group map-get font group id map-get font id font-family map-get font font font-weight map-get font weight font-style map-get font style You're going notice map similar color-stack map code going similar color function vary key parts I'll outline First thing we're going deal font-stack map 5 values needed map Group group name font value shared fonts Examples brandon clarendon even serif ID Font unique identifier unique among group Examples bold light-italic regular Regular default value Font actual font want Include it's stack map variable Weight CSS font-weight font want Style CSS font-style want defined call mixin mixin loop color-stack looking match called group ID found return font-family font-weight font-style properties h1 include font brandon light-italic p include font brandon p include font brandon regular-italic p b include font brandon bold blockquote include font clarendon code include font code Compiles h1 font-family Brandon Grot W01 Light san-serif font-weight 200 font-style italic p font-family Brandon Grot W01-Regular san-serif font-weight 400 font-style normal p font-family Brandon Grot W01-Regular san-serif font-weight 400 font-style italic p b font-family Brandon Grot W01 Black san-serif font-weight 700 font-style normal blockquote font-family Clarendon LT W01 serif font-weight 200 font-style normal code font-family monospace font-weight 400 font-style normal personal note love handling fonts way much always use version mixin even using fonts com project Media Queries final system wanted write media mixin thing media mixin brings table easier set Well that's think anyways media-stack group tablet id general rule screen min-device-width 700px group small id general rule screen min-device-width 1100px group small id inbetween rule screen min-device-width 1100px max-device-width 1400px group large id general rule screen min-device-width 1400px group print id general rule print mixin media group id general media media-stack group map-get media group id map-get media id rule map-get media rule media rule content Right bet notice variable media-stack Much like systems article write options takes three values Group group name query value shared many keys Examples tablet small 1400 ID Query unique identifier unique among group Examples general inbetween exclude Since might rare actual groups default general Rule actual rule want query query NEEDS quotations Sass error two ways using mixin One call it's call nested typically choose nested option keep code together former result smaller CSS file h1 color 333 include media tablet font-size 1rem include media small inbetween font-size 1 2rem include media small color 000 Compiles h1 color 333 media screen min-device-width 700px h1 font-size 1rem media screen min-device-width 1100px max-device-width 1400px h1 font-size 1 2rem media screen min-device-width 1100px h1 color 000 Update Mike Mai made good point often times content dictates breakpoints custom option order we're going make changes system media-stack group tablet id general rule screen min-device-width 700px group small id general rule screen min-device-width 1100px group small id inbetween rule screen min-device-width 1100px max-device-width 1400px group large id general rule screen min-device-width 1400px group print id general rule print group custom id screen rule screen mixin media group id general customRule media media-stack group map-get media group id map-get media id rule map-get media rule media rule customRule content You'll notice added new map called custom basis custom media query id set screen you'll notice targeting screen default You'll also find new parameter called customRule customRule add rule let's say wanted target devices 360px width make h1s blue write like h1 color 333 include media tablet font-size 1rem include media small inbetween font-size 1 2rem include media small color 000 include media custom screen max-device-width 360px color blue output would h1 color 333 media screen min-device-width 700px h1 font-size 1rem media screen min-device-width 1100px max-device-width 1400px h1 font-size 1 2rem media screen min-device-width 1100px h1 color 000 media screen max-device-width 360px h1 color blue stop also utilize customRule EVERY option h1 color 333 include media tablet general min-device-pixel-ratio 2 font-size 1rem include media small inbetween font-size 1 2rem include media small color 000 include media custom screen max-device-width 360px color blue Conclusion Three Sass systems keep code clean maintainable suggestions edits want say hello

FormsNavigationButtonsContentMobileWireframesThinkingResourcesProductsSponsorsWhy Infield Top Aligned Form Labels Quickest Scanby anthony 04 28 15 4 42 pmHow easy users scan form form hard scan could take longer expected users complete leads form abandonment loss potential sign ups way avoid make fields quick scan users first see fill Scanning Pre-fill Post-fillWhen users first see form scan size amount time effort ll take fill scan quickly ll feel like going take much time effort move filling form users scan check input correct fields aren easy check users could fear submitting wrong information abandon form prevent form abandonment make fields quick scan pre-fill post-fill quicker scan less overwhelming form feel less overwhelming form feels motivates users complete Problem Forms TodayMost designers today align form field labels way takes time effort scan two common ways Top aligned labelsInfield labelsWhile quicker scan left aligned labels users still experience scanning issues Top Aligned LabelsMany Visual FixationsIn top aligned form 4 fields scan form feels like fill 8 distinct elements users scan labels fields individual elements separated whitespace result users process elements 8 separate visual fixations extra visual fixations give users scanning makes feel like lot fill Rows WhitespaceTop aligned labels require rows whitespace group labels fields rows whitespace act invisible barriers interrupt user scanning flow Users won fixate long time ll still get short unnecessary fixations fields add form length grows top aligned labels form length grow lot faster fields take space rows whitespace add length even Slow Checking FlowWhen users finish filling fields checking input isn quick either Users sweep eyes label input see match whitespace row field border gets way visual path slows flow Infield LabelsFairly Quick Pre-fill ScanThe common way designers align form labels placing inside field upside method users won feel like fields expected fill field label one element users fixate label also fixate field leaving extra visual fixations Sometimes color contrast infield labels look faint Infield forms use light gray text labels make harder read slower scan Infield labels also rows whitespace create unnecessary visual fixations prevent aligning fields edge-to-edge whereas top aligned forms cannot Slow Painful CheckingThe downside infield labels makes impossible users scan check input submit form label disappears field contains user input Users delete input see label even compare input gone forces use memory recall labels field Infield labels create unnecessary physical work also unnecessary cognitive work cause user frustration leads form abandonment Introducing Infield Top Aligned LabelsThe ideal form quick scan user fills Users need feel form won take much time effort also need feel certain re submitting correct information form meets needs chances users completing high Minimal Visual FixationsIt clear top aligned infield labels aren quickest easiest scan better approach better approach infield top aligned labels Infield top aligned labels require visual fixations possible scanning field contains label user input users scan field fixations hit label input time close proximity lack visual barriers allow users process field quicker Lean CompactInfield top aligned forms take little space possible fields align flush grid removing rows whitespace cause extra fixations creates lean compact form focuses user eye movements concentrated area grid efficient spacing also creates stronger association relevant fields side side placement relevant fields e g first last name allow users focus filling form row row Users need sweep eyes different directions pattern throughout form Easy Input CheckingChecking user input quick easy labels disappear like infield forms visual barriers like top aligned forms Instead one visual fixation per field takes compare label input text styling also helps users check input quicker making input text bold larger label text smaller users distinguish glance Stronger Field FocusWhen users select field top aligned forms field highlights text label users select field infield forms field highlights text label disappear turn faint Infield top aligned labels give users strongest field focus highlight border surrounds field label input altogether Users get clear view field re re typing times strong field focus even important mobile users look keypad type re done typing ll look back form check typed input right field input quick spot re highlighted together Guiding Form GridGrids often used design guide element placement Infield top aligned forms offer form grid help guide field placement Since width fields dictate width form easy figure fields belong next form grid creates stack align fields equidistant rows gives form compact uniform look field enough height fit label input text divide row many fields needed long row width equal others field able hold text form elements well fields enough space fit radio buttons checkboxes select menus needed form elements become apart grid Paper Form MetaphorMost tech-savvy users recognize form fields see older less tech-savvy aren used interacting online forms Infield top aligned forms resemble look paper forms help users feel comfortable filling Infield Top Aligned Form ExamplesFacebook sign form looks overwhelming first glance doesn encourage users fill pain check input Turning infield top aligned label form makes easier look inviting fill Even 4 fields Square sign form takes work scan Turning infield top aligned form makes quicker scan encourages users fill Infield top aligned labels work short simple forms also works complex forms multiple sections Treehouse long sign form multiple sections many elements Turning infield top aligned form makes form lean compact also makes section clearer Top Aligned Infield Labels Might Work BetterNot every form needs quick scanning better conversion Top aligned infield forms still place certain situations Sometimes need form simple implement Top aligned labels would suit better case worry much field sizing label aligning Sometimes re working form fields logins newsletter boxes Infield labels work best situations aren lot labels user needs recall forms almost always field pattern users expect e g username password Different situations call different methods scanning speed conversion important choose infield top aligned labels Final ThoughtsMost websites today either use top aligned infield form labels aren aware better way one infield top aligned labels users won feel discouraged overwhelmed first see form trouble checking input meet user expectations decrease form abandonment form quick possible scan successful

meaningful messages near fields errors Also often need put additional qualifying copy adjacent fields needed isn much space ThanksReply comment Alper Ortac Apr 30th 2015This really like visuals UX infield approach showing validation errors would important addition article Maybe something follow-up Coloring border adding warning icon infield right-aligned would possibility showing error message could done using popout focus Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015For error messages would suggest inline tooltips placed field additional copy would suggest placing information question mark icon next label shows hint text tooltip Reply comment Tim Cross Apr 29th 2015Ok great theory would go building isn default form behaviour examples css html js involved would interested see would argue forms aren shorter actually complicated scan facebook example height apart moving submit button Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015I would argue think height makes infield top aligned forms quicker scan need reread section Reply comment Apr 30th 2015The basic trick looks like form field HTML container say list item border added via CSS Within container label HTML input borders removed via css makes sort invisible put together example http codepen io willthemoor pen dooRagReply comment Mike Donahue May 4th 2015Nice pen like used list element put together also like additional attention detail active field highlight Reply comment Max Avedisian May 19th 2015Thanks putting together struggling found Props Reply comment Drew May 5th 2015Here another example might look like HTML CSS borrowed terminology Bootstrap classes http plnkr co edit fAedI6CCurweavYN5iNS p previewDefinitely do-able cross browser fashion Reply comment Pablo Carrau Apr 29th 2015Great idea always driven nuts checking inline fields always avoided coding way ll definitely try style next project see compares previous ones Thanks Reply comment Sven Uilhoorn Apr 29th 2015One best posts ve seen far UXmovement Finally lengthier in-depth article great examples Reply comment Larry Willis Apr 29th 2015Thank article discussed issue coworkers feel strongly making forms quickly scannable hope article change Reply comment

individual labels halved see Facebook-example supports claim understand issue disappearing labels field contains input 4-5 field signup form hardly issue Also analogy paper forms opinion drawback rather benefit anybody ever great experience filling paper form interesting idea would liked see numbers really doubt approach positive impact smaller forms Reply comment Chris May 5th 2015From accessibility perspective people cognitive deficits trouble remembering 1 2 fields disappearing labels let alone 4 5 10 solution far superior Reply comment Richard May 21st 2015I agree thoughts reduction label size Facebook signup example opinion felt harder scan feel like something quite addressed properly micro copy label doesn approachability friendly appearance large inline type labels think bolsters arguments paper forms Overall intrigued strategy feel much cleaner overall comes simple single-column forms honest though really found harder scan complex multi-column form examples shown think safely adopt lot principles still need bit brainpower find right balance visual spacing sizing form re dealing Reply comment Erwin Apr 30th 2015Interesting Keen code test form like Reply comment Asbj rn Apr 30th 2015Nice idea like concept inline top-aligned labels suggest However point resemblance old-fashioned paper forms hold argument older people recognize form mention fact small text size renders poor potentially unreadable displays low resolution may hold opposing argument words inline top-aligned labels may good thing opinion require high display resolution d say 250 ppi order mimic paper form look good e immensely large input boxes result larger type top-of-the-line mobile phones tablets laptops desktops say different situations call different methods Reply comment John Apr 30th 2015An AMAZING solution obvious Thank anthony Reply comment Pablo Carrau Apr 30th 2015I ve seen done couple mobile apps looked great makes total sense curious anyone seen CSS examples anywhere web Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015Here good example http www jobandtalent com Although like unnecessary asterisks redundant placeholder text Reply comment Mario Fink Apr 30th 2015Interesting idea see potential also pitfalls Anyway created small example could done HTML CSS http jsbin com bojaso 1 edit html css outputReply comment Scot Copeland Apr 30th 2015What consideration given font size regarding usability first thought yes ve tightened distance field cost making text labels approximately 50 smaller Facebook example really made scanning form easier Yes may something connecting label field containing one within one thing ve learned screen-based design font size important especially older visually impaired users still plenty websites make fonts small Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015Of course label readability important scannability labels smaller size example re still readable wanted increase font size would increase field height allow room Reply comment Alex Apr 30th 2015Even better Use floating label method introduced Google Polymer Web Components https www polymer-project org 0 5 components paper-elements demo html paper-inputBest worlds Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015Although Google example similar many usability issues approach label becomes unreadable shrinks tiny font size animated movement unexpected unnecessary sudden change cause confusion playfulness cause distraction field denoted single line mistaken dividers field easiest recognize box affordance Reply comment Joshua Pinter May 4th 2015Moving labels text general difficult follow mentally parse forms looks good loses appeal real-world scenarios Reply comment Gopal Juneja Apr 30th 2015infield top aligned labels Quite interesting reading top aligned infield keen read solution first thought write material design label moves typing also easy check input data good solution complex forms Thanks sharing idea Reply comment Marcus May 1st 2015Excited see article mocked something similar months back inspired floating labels wanting label move see solution error messages https dl dropboxusercontent com u 6404998 form-error pngReply comment Kim Slawson May 13th 2015Nicely done implemented code Reply comment Matt Green May 1st 2015I noticed examples non-text form elements show centered fields aren left aligned labels Reply comment anthony May 4th 2015It center aligned make use available space better visibility left align sometimes leaves lot unused space right Reply comment e May 4th 2015on hand users trained labels look hard left field enter text centering confuse hey space also causing scan white space trying avoidanother thing point white space types forms serve purpose separating field easily see lot white space might make scanning harder px would make easier see without confronted bunch fields one top take tax forms Reply comment Anne Gibson May 4th 2015Curious thoughts accessibility form field highlighted would still border indicate active field built HTML container holds label tag text field tag need click back text field know ve missed well work screen reader 200 zoomed situation require Javascript Reply comment anthony May 14th 2015Yes would highlight border active Clicking either label field tag highlight entire field ll know missed Reply comment Joshua Pinter May 4th 2015Kumail kumailht time even created

fallbacks it's years figured could subject better justice go Intro SVG Fallbacks CSS-Tricks there's lot information telling wonderful SVG much want convince SVG Everybody SVG isn't widely used would like fact people still literally don't get SVG Maybe stuck office computer hasn't updated since guy quit six years ago maybe they're using second-hand refurbished phone can't afford upgrade maybe don't understand don't care updating new browser Whatever reason approximately 5 users browsing web web browsers can't display SVG USA according caniuse data tech-oriented web sites like one afford say support modern web browsers sites can't ignore 1 20 potential customers want give 95 users modern browsers benefits SVG still provide functional experience others need fallback plan KIND fallback need getting technical options implementing fallbacks helps stop think kind fallback need fallback SVG icon whose meaning clearly expressed text label may able let icon disappear without compromising site's functionality Text fallback SVG icon whose meaning could expressed text label maybe need ensure alt text shows place Image fallback people think SVG fallback PNG GIF image represents graphic

SVG Flash rewrite interaction code ActionScript could use Rapha l draw manipulate graphic provides single JavaScript interface SVG VML vector graphics supported Internet Explorer 6-8 means Rapha l

images browser doesn't support specified image format picture source type image svg xml srcset image svg img src image png alt picture Unfortunately that's much use support SVG much better support picture polyfill picture element though Picturefill Sara Soueidan article covers Advantages get fallback images specify different fallbacks different media queries part picture syntax Meaning

Trick inline SVG trickery pull svg width 96 height 96 image xlink href image svg src image png width 96 height 96 svg sure add sizing attributes image fills entire SVG size svg modern browsers image old ones CSS Besides excluding older browsers support SVG images inline SVG main limitation lot work get images display correct size fluid site You'll need use tricks used get SVG scale consistent aspect ratio instead setting width 100 letting height adjust automatically Advantages Requires JavaScript dependencies Disadvantages Triggers multiple aborted requests IE Older iOS display fallback even though SVG supported Tests Fallback SVG object inline SVG become better supported SVG object fallen favor That's unfortunate progressive enhancement graceful degradation perspective easiest way provide fallback content child content object element displayed object cannot content html content images formatted text even another object example one containing Flash version animated SVG object

page speed today right even bother Well starters Faster user experience conversions higher core search engine rankings long-tail traffic lower bounce rate Let's get straight apply 7 core page speed principles there's reason site shouldn't loading one second giving killer benefits Skim headers bullet points quick dirty need explanation specific point it's Otherwise post reply let's talk 1 Reduce HTTP Requests HTTP requests happen one time browser open close connection request makes sense possible Here's trim fat Anything done image done CSS designers cut slide gradient photoshop apply repeat-x That's cool ton different elements create CSS gradient button Heck one guy created entire Simpsons cast CSS I'm saying go far don't lazy convert example image-based shadow CSS shadow Combine CSS Files JS Files Organization important don't need header css footer css buttons css forms css etc don't create one style css import either Copy paste one style css file create table contents top Javascript jQuery Reduce Plugin Dependency Reduce plugin dependency introduce tons extra CSS JS files can't combined without huge headache may used one page like contact form plugin force every page load files Get rid know social plugins everyone loves Look analytics see really receiving engagement Otherwise chop'em Facebook widget instance requires 20 additional HTTP requests Look Font Usage Google Fonts awesome awesome theme designers want use 5 6 fonts per theme Reduce two one feel must use Better yet host server Even better use system fonts aren't loading anything make sure cover Windows OSX Linux system user's computer work Minimize Redirects There's really reason may find site lot redirects place Let's say you're telling browser look theme my-site display styles js mobile-menu js point designer wanted move CSS JS Fonts one folder elsewhere instead finding locations called files set redirect every file you're demanding two HTTP requests instead one Fix Use CSS Sprite Sheets Imagine site eCommerce site Buy button images icons footer woman phone ear telling customers call support images payment options reduce requests one creating CSS Sprite sheet one large image contains repeatedly used images You'll tell site find sheet using Cartesian coordinates x y huge win 2 Shrink Page Size instead 100 HTTP Requests you're loading 30 It's faster still slow you're asking visitor load 5 MB worth stuff per page load That's absurd Let's shrink way Save Compress non-critical images JPGs JPG file format contains enough information display image web sharply enough without bloated attempted distribute JPG file someone print keep offline it'd come blurry lot times text render awkwardly well Use JPG want quality don't need perfection image meant display without elements need sharpness use JPG format compress maintaining quality using TinyJPG Save small images GIFs GIF format essentially maximally compressed destructive manner Big GIF images small complex images appear blurry format Save small non-complex images GIFs Use don't go overboard visuals matter lot making CSS sprite sheet Save Compress critical images PNGs logo's images text need look crisp anything requires sharpness use PNG format head TinyPNG compress Present brand's important images using PNG format Use Right Resolution Don't force user load 800x600 resolution photo you're displaying 200x150 Resize compress big savings displaying images responsive site best easiest option find happy medium size desktop mobile Mobile speeds slow right serving different images based viewport size complex right quick tip Smush Text Files Optimize CSS file reducing specificity re-using elements using shorthand coding minify JS file Take code used CSS JS HTML files 3 Optimize Database Performance you're designing 5 page business lander don't need database site content magazine 10 000 product eCommerce site database unavoidable ATTN Always take backup database run queries get away don't use database go completely flat file HTML PHP Content Management Systems CMS help flat file management medium sized sites Bypass database completely don't make life harder needs Database-dependent sites still fly Reduce Bloat Look dashboard see 200 000 spam unaccepted comments see post 20 revisions drafts plan using 50 categories ended using 10 even use tags set 100 extra user accounts used Get rid Anything extra accounts taxonomies trash bin full stuff Delete you're using Wordpress WP-Optimize works great 4 Render Above-The-Fold First Perceived page speed user important search engines measure Make sure visitors see full experience soon possible land making everything above-the-fold appear first user begin enjoying site rest loads behind scenes fallback system font pre-load webfonts annoying thing site load words font one last things come defining system font CSS file get text screen immediately asking user's computer show text using something like Helvetica Arial font loads Inline right CSS elements Generally don't want CSS inline HTML document However one place that's worth above-the-fold elements inlining CSS within HTML's head make sure loads HTML document first instead waiting CSS file downloaded read Move Render-Blocking JS Footer design-critical Javascript jQuery may block rendering above-the-fold area it's placed HTML head Move footer visually load top page It's unlikely user want interact anything JS chance load they'll see might want interact quicker 5 Use Caching Types Let say first always compare before-and-after effects caching Depending server location size site variables could actually slow loading It's rare aware Otherwise get ready cache cached allow can't get rid axe it's on-site cached situations on-site files can't cached fix files dynamic variables attached CSS file listed style css v012 get rid v012 won't cached visitor's browser Off-site resources can't cached either like Google TypeKit fonts million requests attached Facebook widget hot-linked images know Enable Browser Caching visitor's browser caching items they'll load immediately upon refresh second page view want obviously careful Don't set expiry high users

('An Introduction To Graphical Effects in CSS', 'Toggle navigation Adobe Dreamweaver Team Blog Customer Stories Part Story Subscribe blog Categories Archives Toggle navigation Adobe Dreamweaver Team Blog Customer Stories Part Story Subscribe blog Categories Archives Introduction Graphical Effects CSS Posted April 29 2015 Sara Soueidan Code Uncategorized past couple years CSS gotten set new properties allow us create quite advanced graphical effects right browsers using lines code without resort graphics editors achieve effects like sounds like music ears well graphics editors would choose code path graphical editor path day CSS allows us graphical work right text editors Examples graphical effects create using CSS today include textured text effects photo effects like color editing tweaking photo element blending also enable us blend elements elements clipping content arbitrary shapes even wrap content arbitrary shapes CSS CSS gone long way article want give overview CSS features allow us create graphical effects namely blend modes filter effects Color Blending CSS Blend Modes re designer frequently fires graphics editor Photoshop Illustrator ve inevitably come across blending modes point work since blending one frequently used effects graphic print design Blending operations also known blend modes provide us fine level color blending control enables us perform operations inverting colours mixing highlighting Different blend modes used yield different effects blend mode used specify element known source blend backdrop also known destination CSS element backdrop content behind element element composited Compositing fancy term process combining graphic element backdrop blend two elements CSS areas elements overlap affected blend mode choose imagine areas two elements blended CSS Compositing Blending specification introduced CSS already offered us one way compositing elements known simple alpha compositing opacity property changing element opacity browser makes translucent colours backdrop show Today two main properties exist CSS compositing blending specification enable us blend elements elements element background images specifying one 16 available blend modes two properties background-blend-mode mix-blend-mode Blending Background Images Using background-blend-mode Property background-blend-mode property name suggests used specify blend mode element background layer background layer image background color background-blend-mode property used specify blend mode background layer element one background image specify multiple blend modes blend mode used background image first blend mode list corresponds first background image list background images example background-image url first-image png url second-image png background-color orange background-blend-mode screen multiply second-image png background blend background color using multiply mode first-image png background blend second image background color using screen blend mode Reminder first background image list one top ones following beneath background images blend blend content lies underneath element 16 blend modes available CSS normal default blend mode means blending applied multiply screen overlay darken lighten color-dodge color-burn hard-light soft-light difference exclusion hue saturation color luminosity sake brevity refrain going technical detail modes recommend article instead learn blend modes modify colours background image resulting different effect mode hardest part comes picking blend mode achieve specific effect knowing mode pick hard impossible predict result applying certain blend mode image following image shows set results achieved applying mentioned blend modes image image blended red background color order blending operations top left corner image order mentioned list result applying different blend modes image order mentioned starting top left corner Usually way choose blend mode trial error Apply blend modes image settle one achieves effect re blend modes however yield expected results memorise use whenever need example luminosity mode allows create monotone images bottom right corner handy tip keep mind re creating big header image white heading top became trendy past year part article wrote back created interactive demo allows upload image preview different blend modes play demo Screenshot interactive blend modes demo Blending background images great achieve really neat effects using property following image shows example blending element background image linear gradient image also used second background image element image taken live demo Codrops CSS Reference result blending linear gradient background image photo background image element creative effects created get blend element elements page useful images re blending need foreground images background images want blend piece text example image behind mix-blend-mode property comes Blending Elements Backdrop using mix-blend-mode Probably one useful practical use cases mixing elements mixing piece text image behind interesting effects come Think fixed headers blending content page scrolls text blended image background text blending text etc Using mix-blend-mode property exactly like background-blend-mode property accepts one 16 blend mode values available see action refer interactive demo mentioned earlier following screen recording shows add piece text blend image choice using one different blend modes Screenshot interactive demo showing mix-blend-mode property action example blending piece text background image behind could look like following Assuming piece text contained wrapper background image applied could something like div class wrapper h1 blended heading h1 div wrapper background-image url path image jpg background-size cover h1 mix-blend-mode multiply styles also blend text text allowing achieve nice colourful text overlapping effects like one shown top right corner following image effects shown image achieved using different CSS blend modes Examples effects created using CSS blend modes Using negative margins relative positioning shift position one word overlaps word next apply mix-blend-mode word blend word possibilities endless Blending Notes Sometimes may want blend image element backdrop want blend group elements together prevent elements blending content behind stacking contexts come play using property called isolation isolate group elements blend blend content page creating stacking context element isolate content element prevent blending backdrop element However still apply blend mode entire context blend backdrop Moreover using background-blend-mode property isolation property needed since background layers must blend content behind element instead must act rendered isolated group element specified specification isolation property effect used mix-blend-mode property background-blend-mode property learn isolation property Note mix-blend-mode property also allows mix blend SVG elements Browser Support CSS blend modes support getting better day keep eye browser compatibility background-blend-mode property support mix-blend-mode found Whether property full browser support always start using part progressively enhancing workflow blend modes used enhance page designs falling back non-blended alternatives non-supporting browsers using feature today ll help push forward design eventually look right browsers support features let limited browser support stop fun properties today Image Adjustments CSS Filter Effects filter effect graphical operation applied image drawn document described operation passes image filter renders output image screen One way think like filter placed front camera lens re seeing lens outside world modified effect filter see screen content modified filters applied apply filter image using CSS use filter property defined CSS Filter Effects specification Filter effects include example blur effects drop shadows colour shifting manipulation like saturating desaturating colours among others ten primitive filter effects CSS filter applied element passing filter function filter property ten filter functions blur brightness contrast grayscale hue-rotate invert opacity saturate sepia drop-shadow url functions used manipulate image pixels colours function takes parameter value specifies degree intensity filter applied Conceptually parts element effected filter operations includes content background borders text decoration outline visible scrolling mechanism element filter applied descendants blur function blur function used blur element applying Gaussian Blur element takes length value parameter value needs positive number cannot set percentages larger value blurred element value zero leave element unchanged interesting since parameter blur function length value means use possible length unit like em rem following examples valid blur values blur 5em blur 7px blur 0 filter blur equivalent blur 0 following image shows result applying 10px blur image brightness function brightness function used manipulate image brightness used make image look less bright adjusts image colours completely black zero brightness original image colours 100 brightness value zero render image completely black value 100 increase image brightness also specify amount brightness using number instead percentage percentage value 65 example would expressed 0 65 instead example following valid brightness values brightness 150 brightness 0 brightness 0 7 brightness 0 01 brightness 200 brightness 10 following image shows result applying 200 brightness image result applying 200 brightness image contrast function contrast function adjusts contrast image adjusts difference darkest lightest parts image function similar brightness function like brightness value zero render image completely black value increases towards 100 difference darkness changes see original image 100 Values beyond 100 increase difference light dark areas even value passed contrast function defaults 100 image changed contrast also takes values brightness following valid examples contrast 150 contrast 0 contrast 0 7 contrast 0 01 contrast 200 contrast 10 following image shows result applying 200 contrast image result applying 200 contrast image one angry cat grayscale function grayscale function converts image shade grey value also percentage decimal number equivalent percentage However percentage values need 0 100 value greater 100 clamped 100 0 leaves image unchanged 100 makes completely grey higher go zero 100 image loses colours becomes grey following examples valid greyscale values filter grayscale defaults grayscale 100 filter grayscale 1 grayscale 100 filter grayscale 36 filter grayscale 0 28 following image shows result applying 100 grayscale image result applying 100 grayscale image hue-rotate function hue-rotate filter function rotates colours image angle passed function parameter simpler way understand would imagine color wheel Every color color wheel angle positioned start one point color circle move along circle certain angle end another point another color hue-rotate function selects color input image rotates angle value passed outputs image input colors replaced new colors colors image shifted way produce new colors value zero renders image unchanged maximum angle rotation 360 degrees value angle provided defaults value 0deg image changed following image shows result applying 120deg hue rotation image result applying 120deg hue rotation image invert function invert function inverts colours image takes value 0 100 higher go zero 100 image look inverted value 100 completely inverted colours flipped image looks like photo negative like ones generated old non-digital cameras value 100 clamped back 100 value 0 leaves input unchanged Note pass value invert function defaults 100 image completely inverted percentage values also represented decimal numbers well following examples valid invert values invert equivalent invert 100 invert 0 24 invert 60 following image shows result inverting image colours completely using 100 default value result inverting image colours completely using 100 default value opacity function opacity function similar functionality CSS opacity property accepts values 0 1 equivalent 100 100 means image element fully opaque go 100 zero element becomes translucent becomes completely transparent zero content page lies behind show Even pass value greater 1 browser clamp 1 100 Negative values allowed following image shows result applying 0 5 opacity value image result applying 120deg hue rotation image saturate function saturate function saturates colours image making look vivid takes value zero 100 value equivalent decimal number value 100 leaves image colours unchanged value zero completely desaturates image higher value saturates image values greater 100 super-saturate image Negative values also allowed Saturating images particularly useful image colours looking dull want give lively appearance following example shows result applying 250 saturation value image result applying 250 saturation value image sepia function Ever heard sepia effect likely effect gives vintage appearance image sepia function gets name fact adjusts image giving sepia tinge like old photographs like previous functions takes value percentage decimal 0 100 higher go zero stronger sepia effect Values greater 100 clamped 100 following result applying 100 sepia tone image result applying 100 sepia tone image drop-shadow function box-shadow CSS property allows us apply box shadow element means even non-rectangular element non-rectangular image like PNG shadow applied element going rectangular element rectangular box many scenarios unwanted results example suppose following PNG image star Since PNG made fully transparent areas star opaque area want apply drop shadow image ll likely want achieve following result image drop shadow applied Using box-shadow d end something like instead image box shadow applied looks ugly drop-shadow filter function allows us achieve previous result drop-shadow function takes value similar value accepted box-shadow property except drop-shadow function shadow include spread radius like box-shadow inset keyword also allowed drop-shadow function ll assume re familiar values box-shadow property please refer entry Codrops CSS Reference list possible values detailed explanation examples apply drop shadow using drop-shadow pass value shadow want simply apply image example png-img filter drop-shadow 10px 10px 3px rgba 0 0 0 0 3 url function url function allows use filter defined SVG document apply element Instead using one 10 filters define filter SVG apply element referencing filter ID url function example filter external SVG file filter url myFilters xml effect filter defined main page url myFilter following example blur filter defined SVG svg height 0 xmlns http www w3 org 2000 svg filter id myFilter x -5 y -5 width 110 height 110 feGaussianBlur SourceGraphic stdDeviation 8 filter svg Referencing filter CSS applying element would apply Gaussian blur filter element Since SVG filters big wide topic won getting details article Live Demo CSS Filters supported browsers showed screenshots effects previous examples said still play filter values following live demo See Pen 7405c808441c8021bb6bc59baef72441 Sara Soueidan SaraSoueidan CodePen like CSS blend modes use CSS filters enhance pages need wait full browser support start playing taking advantage cool CSS feature Multiple filters apply multiple filters image element apply multiple filters element order apply filters matters changes final output element apply multiple filters filters space-separated example filter sepia 1 brightness 150 contrast 0 5 Animating filters Filters also animated allows create really creative effects example multiple filters animated image following image fading effect Lucas Bebber See Pen Pretty Fade Lucas Bebber lbebber CodePen Lucas work extraordinary might want check Codepen profile beautiful experiments sure spark creativity curiosity Order Graphical Operations addition blending filters element could also clipped masked apply one graphical operation element browser needs decide operation apply first depending order end result would different one specified order operations CSS according specification first filter effect applied clipping masking blending compositing Inspiration long ago Dudley Storey created neat experiment using CSS blend modes clipping paths create 3D Glasses effect Screenshot Dudley 3D Glasses demo using CSS blend modes check demo tutorial Final Words CSS Blend Modes Filters two features

continue paying servers software bandwidth support incoming money cover costs remotely possible provide product life recurring costs associated brought new owner point apparently folks running Nodeki

Domain RegistrationCase point maximum domain name renewal ten years however Network Solutions sell 100 years domain name renewals 999 Every decade they'll ensure domain renewed Sounds pretty good right Unfortunately original link Network Solution's 100 year offer page longer works doesn't exactly inspire confidence However company still offers service I've always thought Network Solutions overpriced domain registrar I'm personally tempted renew domain 9 99 even 100 times get discount rely Network Solutions stick around 90 years knows money invest looks like possibly keep domain name

FormsNavigationButtonsContentMobileWireframesThinkingResourcesProductsSponsorsWhy Infield Top Aligned Form Labels Quickest Scanby anthony 04 28 15 4 42 pmHow easy users scan form form hard scan could take longer expected users complete leads form abandonment loss potential sign ups way avoid make fields quick scan users first see fill Scanning Pre-fill Post-fillWhen users first see form scan size amount time effort ll take fill scan quickly ll feel like going take much time effort move filling form users scan check input correct fields aren easy check users could fear submitting wrong information abandon form prevent form abandonment make fields quick scan pre-fill post-fill quicker scan less overwhelming form feel less overwhelming form feels motivates users complete Problem Forms TodayMost designers today align form field labels way takes time effort scan two common ways Top aligned labelsInfield labelsWhile quicker scan left aligned labels users still experience scanning issues Top Aligned LabelsMany Visual FixationsIn top aligned form 4 fields scan form feels like fill 8 distinct elements users scan labels fields individual elements separated whitespace result users process elements 8 separate visual fixations extra visual fixations give users scanning makes feel like lot fill Rows WhitespaceTop aligned labels require rows whitespace group labels fields rows whitespace act invisible barriers interrupt user scanning flow Users won fixate long time ll still get short unnecessary fixations fields add form length grows top aligned labels form length grow lot faster fields take space rows whitespace add length even Slow Checking FlowWhen users finish filling fields checking input isn quick either Users sweep eyes label input see match whitespace row field border gets way visual path slows flow Infield LabelsFairly Quick Pre-fill ScanThe common way designers align form labels placing inside field upside method users won feel like fields expected fill field label one element users fixate label also fixate field leaving extra visual fixations Sometimes color contrast infield labels look faint Infield forms use light gray text labels make harder read slower scan Infield labels also rows whitespace create unnecessary visual fixations prevent aligning fields edge-to-edge whereas top aligned forms cannot Slow Painful CheckingThe downside infield labels makes impossible users scan check input submit form label disappears field contains user input Users delete input see label even compare input gone forces use memory recall labels field Infield labels create unnecessary physical work also unnecessary cognitive work cause user frustration leads form abandonment Introducing Infield Top Aligned LabelsThe ideal form quick scan user fills Users need feel form won take much time effort also need feel certain re submitting correct information form meets needs chances users completing high Minimal Visual FixationsIt clear top aligned infield labels aren quickest easiest scan better approach better approach infield top aligned labels Infield top aligned labels require visual fixations possible scanning field contains label user input users scan field fixations hit label input time close proximity lack visual barriers allow users process field quicker Lean CompactInfield top aligned forms take little space possible fields align flush grid removing rows whitespace cause extra fixations creates lean compact form focuses user eye movements concentrated area grid efficient spacing also creates stronger association relevant fields side side placement relevant fields e g first last name allow users focus filling form row row Users need sweep eyes different directions pattern throughout form Easy Input CheckingChecking user input quick easy labels disappear like infield forms visual barriers like top aligned forms Instead one visual fixation per field takes compare label input text styling also helps users check input quicker making input text bold larger label text smaller users distinguish glance Stronger Field FocusWhen users select field top aligned forms field highlights text label users select field infield forms field highlights text label disappear turn faint Infield top aligned labels give users strongest field focus highlight border surrounds field label input altogether Users get clear view field re re typing times strong field focus even important mobile users look keypad type re done typing ll look back form check typed input right field input quick spot re highlighted together Guiding Form GridGrids often used design guide element placement Infield top aligned forms offer form grid help guide field placement Since width fields dictate width form easy figure fields belong next form grid creates stack align fields equidistant rows gives form compact uniform look field enough height fit label input text divide row many fields needed long row width equal others field able hold text form elements well fields enough space fit radio buttons checkboxes select menus needed form elements become apart grid Paper Form MetaphorMost tech-savvy users recognize form fields see older less tech-savvy aren used interacting online forms Infield top aligned forms resemble look paper forms help users feel comfortable filling Infield Top Aligned Form ExamplesFacebook sign form looks overwhelming first glance doesn encourage users fill pain check input Turning infield top aligned label form makes easier look inviting fill Even 4 fields Square sign form takes work scan Turning infield top aligned form makes quicker scan encourages users fill Infield top aligned labels work short simple forms also works complex forms multiple sections Treehouse long sign form multiple sections many elements Turning infield top aligned form makes form lean compact also makes section clearer Top Aligned Infield Labels Might Work BetterNot every form needs quick scanning better conversion Top aligned infield forms still place certain situations Sometimes need form simple implement Top aligned labels would suit better case worry much field sizing label aligning Sometimes re working form fields logins newsletter boxes Infield labels work best situations aren lot labels user needs recall forms almost always field pattern users expect e g username password Different situations call different methods scanning speed conversion important choose infield top aligned labels Final ThoughtsMost websites today either use top aligned infield form labels aren aware better way one infield top aligned labels users won feel discouraged overwhelmed first see form trouble checking input meet user expectations decrease form abandonment form quick possible scan successful form doesn reduce work users fingers also work eyes Others also read Form Label Proximity Right Aligned Easier ScanWhy Users Fill Less Mark Required FieldsHow Put Labels Inside Textboxes

experiences fights user 48 Responses Infield Top Aligned Form Labels Quickest Scan Rob Apr 28th 2015Interesting couple things jump mind though handle validation errors Without white space hard put meaningful messages near fields errors Also often need put additional qualifying copy adjacent fields needed isn much space ThanksReply comment Alper Ortac Apr 30th 2015This really like visuals UX infield approach showing validation errors would important addition article Maybe something follow-up Coloring border adding warning icon infield right-aligned would possibility showing error message could done using popout focus Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015For error messages would suggest inline tooltips placed field additional copy would suggest placing information question mark icon next label shows hint text tooltip Reply comment Tim Cross Apr 29th 2015Ok great theory would go building isn default form behaviour examples css html js involved would interested see would argue forms aren shorter actually complicated scan facebook example height apart moving submit button Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015I would argue think height makes infield top aligned forms quicker scan need reread section Reply comment Apr 30th 2015The basic trick looks like form field HTML container say list item border added via CSS Within container label HTML input borders removed via css makes sort invisible put together example http codepen io willthemoor pen dooRagReply comment Mike Donahue May 4th 2015Nice pen like used list element put together also like additional attention detail active field highlight Reply comment Max Avedisian May 19th 2015Thanks putting together struggling found Props Reply comment Drew May 5th 2015Here another example might look like HTML CSS borrowed terminology Bootstrap classes http plnkr co edit fAedI6CCurweavYN5iNS p previewDefinitely do-able cross browser fashion Reply comment Pablo Carrau Apr 29th 2015Great idea always driven nuts checking inline fields always avoided coding way ll definitely try style next project see compares previous ones Thanks Reply comment Sven Uilhoorn Apr 29th 2015One best posts ve seen far UXmovement Finally lengthier in-depth article great examples Reply comment Larry Willis Apr 29th 2015Thank article discussed issue coworkers feel strongly making forms quickly scannable hope article change Reply comment

individual labels halved see Facebook-example supports claim understand issue disappearing labels field contains input 4-5 field signup form hardly issue Also analogy paper forms opinion drawback rather benefit anybody ever great experience filling paper form interesting idea would liked see numbers really doubt approach positive impact smaller forms Reply comment Chris May 5th 2015From accessibility perspective people cognitive deficits trouble remembering 1 2 fields disappearing labels let alone 4 5 10 solution far superior Reply comment Richard May 21st 2015I agree thoughts reduction label size Facebook signup example opinion felt harder scan feel like something quite addressed properly micro copy label doesn approachability friendly appearance large inline type labels think bolsters arguments paper forms Overall intrigued strategy feel much cleaner overall comes simple single-column forms honest though really found harder scan complex multi-column form examples shown think safely adopt lot principles still need bit brainpower find right balance visual spacing sizing form re dealing Reply comment Erwin Apr 30th 2015Interesting Keen code test form like Reply comment Asbj rn Apr 30th 2015Nice idea like concept inline top-aligned labels suggest However point resemblance old-fashioned paper forms hold argument older people recognize form mention fact small text size renders poor potentially unreadable displays low resolution may hold opposing argument words inline top-aligned labels may good thing opinion require high display resolution d say 250 ppi order mimic paper form look good e immensely large input boxes result larger type top-of-the-line mobile phones tablets laptops desktops say different situations call different methods Reply comment John Apr 30th 2015An AMAZING solution obvious Thank anthony Reply comment Pablo Carrau Apr 30th 2015I ve seen done couple mobile apps looked great makes total sense curious anyone seen CSS examples anywhere web Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015Here good example http www jobandtalent com Although like unnecessary asterisks redundant placeholder text Reply comment Mario Fink Apr 30th 2015Interesting idea see potential also pitfalls Anyway created small example could done HTML CSS http jsbin com bojaso 1 edit html css outputReply comment Scot Copeland Apr 30th 2015What consideration given font size regarding usability first thought yes ve tightened distance field cost making text labels approximately 50 smaller Facebook example really made scanning form easier Yes may something connecting label field containing one within one thing ve learned screen-based design font size important especially older visually impaired users still plenty websites make fonts small Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015Of course label readability important scannability labels smaller size example re still readable wanted increase font size would increase field height allow room Reply comment Alex Apr 30th 2015Even better Use floating label method introduced Google Polymer Web Components https www polymer-project org 0 5 components paper-elements demo html paper-inputBest worlds Reply comment anthony Apr 30th 2015Although Google example similar many usability issues approach label becomes unreadable shrinks tiny font size animated movement unexpected unnecessary sudden

enter text centering confuse hey space also causing scan white space trying avoidanother thing point white space types forms serve purpose separating field easily see lot white space might make scanning harder px would make easier see without confronted bunch fields one top take tax forms Reply comment Anne Gibson May 4th 2015Curious thoughts accessibility form field highlighted would still border indicate active field built HTML container holds label tag text field tag need click back text field know ve missed well work screen reader 200 zoomed situation require Javascript Reply comment
