finding feet source Universal Studios great quarrel sequel characterisation heavily stereotyped German acappella group Das Sound Machine positioned Bellas enemy one huge Kraftwerk rip-off lots outdated stereotypical Germanic traits cold calculating mean wear black shirts bit disconcerting lead singer simply given character name Kommissar translates commissioner actress playing Danish name

several films need actually follow source material course getting fans books pissed half fun movie based Spook Apprentice English author Joseph Delaney first part Wardstone Chronicles aside name dropping characters book movie bears little resemblance source material Guaranteed sure fire hit right Spoilers film opens Master Gregory Jeff Bridges knight order Spooks imprisoning evil witch Mother Malkin Julianne Moore inside nasty pit movie North American release book Spook Apprentice changed title derogatory historical nature word spook reason filmmakers decided keep name script resulted cringing every time someone called Jeff Bridges spook ll change everything else book flash forward couple decades find Master Gregory getting drunk local tavern libations interrupted apprentice Mr Bradley Kit Harrington informs master young girl possessed needs help Gregory drunken asshat ignores apprentice continues drink soldier offended Gregory callous behavior tries intervene even drunk Gregory badass fighter completely humiliates soldier wondering supposed hero film church bells ring apparently means spook required Gregory must answer call exactly point Gregory beating random soldier whose sole crime wanting Gregory bloody job didn say please Gregory Jon Snow mean Mr Bradley head local church find young girl chained baptismal font Turns young lass possessed Mother Malkin escaped due rising Blood Moon increases evil powers nonsense Gregory doesn seem much trouble exorcising Malkin girl witch turns dragon things get bit dicier m getting old shit manage trap Malkin iron cage sadly able pull poor Mr Bradley Gregory forced burn Even worse completely fails kill Mother Malkin bursts burning cage full dragon glory later learn Gregory several apprentices years dead Master Gregory drunken jerk also bad job course Gregory doesn blame needs better apprentices decides find seventh son seventh son apparently super powerful Tom Ward seventh son seventh son assistant pig-keeper Master Gregory pays bag gold Tom Ward Ben Barnes whose family doesn seem qualms letting son run man whose track record apprentices quite terrible Tom mom Olivia Williams give son mysterious pendant one assumes turn useful really stupid MacGuffin heroes villains squabble Pretty cool lightsabre time d normally get master apprentice training sequence instead montage months years training poor Tom finds week stop Mother Malkin even though previous apprentices ten years training dead Gregory really banking whole seventh son thing makes one wonder went anything else past m assuming seventh son seventh son got rare Gregory found one within five minutes looking Gregory takes young Tom nearby city get supplies one typical medieval fantasy cities could economically survive plopped barren rocky peninsula middle wasteland signs type agriculture could support populace cool visual makes logical sense simply import everything wandering logistical wonder city Tom runs Alice Alicia Vikander film love interest danger burned witch local mob Tom informs mob apprentice spook take care witch mob hands Tom mosey opposed wanting hang around watch spook kill witch one would think angry mobs want Maybe town suffering kind ennui spell turned newt reason Tom intervention Alice girl one visions Yes visions go would needed supernatural visions make want rescue girl angry mob interesting Alice actually witch mother Bony Lizzie Antje Traue notorious witch sister Mother Malkin kind thing bothered Nicholas Cage film Season Witch people trying burn witches live enlightened times look back people ignorant assholes universe movie witches really deserve good burning Sure turns Alice evil witch like Malkin league really blame mob wanting dead film makes sympathize witch burners made drastic misstep Tom mother-in-law actually witch hot cool rest movie typical fantasy road picture Gregory Tom encounter various monsters witches get final showdown Mother Malkin Director Sergey Bodrov assembled quite good cast movie either phoning going top m sure Jeff Bridges going Master Gregory completely unlikable gives voice cross Rooster Cogburn Tom Hardy Bane laughably bad Ben Barnes bland throughout films running time one think much better would Kit Harrington hadn died beginning film Julianne Moore swinging fences portrayal evil Mother Malkin beyond cartoonish Speaking cartoonish movies visual effects course CGI range bad decent Looking fight Lou Ferigno Sinbad mentioned movie based popular book series pretty much everything names changed book Tom Ward twelve year old Mother Malkin doesn escape imprisonment Blood Moon tricks young Tom letting Tom save Alice mob actually way around saves group bullies m saying sticking book closely would resulted better movie certainly
