technical barriers achieving germline alteration human clinical application Luigi Naldini Luigi Naldini Whereas gene disruption easily within reach current technologies gene editing Gene editing would required situ correction mutation editing risk- disease-causing allelic variant relies gene targeting artificial endonucleases homologous recombination using exogenous template Current methods gene

embryos reasonable chance generate edited cells obvious strategy identify select even fewer treated embryos carrying desired edit inner mass cells unless forced selection genetic switch built-in within template majority treated embryos would carry targeted possibly disrupted allele absence forced selection rarely occurring situation gene correction per se endows ES cells selective advantage embryos carrying edited cells would chimeras Second current embryo screening implantation strategies would address occurrence extent chimeras seem hardly compatible expected efficiency Gene editing combined exogenous genetic selection would entail substantial genetic modification germline incorporation exogenous selector similar GMOs currently used agriculture transgenic animal models raise even

efficient delivery protocols lessen possibility chimerism resulting organism major outstanding technical barriers achieving germline alteration human clinical application individual health risks

dominant diseases couple autosomal recessive disease may add candidates approach many terms enhancement we're far knowing understanding 'enhancing' genes point individual benefits asymptotic zero Lovell-Badge course justification attempting gene editing humans must balance risk benefit clinical need important Experiments mice suggest gene editing experiments led noticeable effects apart expected targeting gene question However subtle problems missed problems causing early embryo lethality mice humans Although off-target effects may rare whether serious going hard predict without 'human experiment' Second genetic mosaicism could problem depending gene edited cases gene mutations mice studied mosaics chimeras two embryos joined together resulting phenotype worse gene mutated cells However generally one expects milder version phenotype Unanticipated effects on-target changes could occur insufficient knowledge gene works change engineered might cases lead example new

Jennifer Doudna Jennifer Doudna Dana Carroll G Steven Martin Michael Botchan would list least five risks First applications would confounded on-target mutagenesis NHEJ example one could unintentionally convert sickle cell disease beta thalassemia Second although likelihood off-target effects minimized still possibility essential gene could mutated individual already heterozygous mutation gene would give two mutant alleles genes haploinsufficient single mutant allele would affect Genes X chromosome present single copy males expressed one parental chromosome cells females mutations represent greater risk Third 'edited' individual chimeric intended correction may still diseased cells critical tissues Fourth genetic background disease mutation exists may level adapted carrying mutation correcting gene back 'wild type' could unanticipated consequences background would classify tertiary concern seems unlikely significant consequences Finally hard predict assess unintended long-term consequences germline editing effects occur later life result specific genetic background individual Cohen Mostly speculative point though one predict basis historical precedent new technologies e g Jesse Gelsinger see timeline off-target unintended effects almost certainly occur Perry risks depend targeted sequence sequences may enable extremely high specificity whereas others don't may serious off-target consequences occur whereas others may overt consequences Another issue unanticipated effects on-target changes introducing improving genome modification may always without attendant disadvantages example heterozygous carriers HbS single-nucleotide polymorphism sickle cell disease eliminate sickle cell disease increase risk contracting malaria Benefits general include eliminating many 3 000 single-gene heritable disease traits mind chimerism lower technical risk firstly system already efficient secondly would highly prescriptive leading identical end points

scientists discover microbes acquire electricity making methane New findings Stanford engineering Professor Alfred Spormann colleagues could pave way microbial factories produce renewable biofuels chemicals Mark Shwartz Mark Shwartz Colonies microbes produce methane gas compounds lab Stanford Professor Alfred Spormann research goal create large microbial factories convert electricity carbon dioxide renewable biofuels chemicals Stanford University scientists solved long-standing mystery methanogens unique microorganisms transform electricity carbon dioxide methane new study Stanford team demonstrates first time methanogens obtain electrons solid surfaces discovery could help scientists design electrodes microbial factories produce methane gas compounds sustainably several hypotheses explain electrons get electrode methanogen cell said Stanford postdoctoral scholar J rg Deutzmann lead author study first group identify actual mechanism study published current issue journal mBio overall goal create large bioreactors microbes convert atmospheric carbon dioxide clean electricity solar wind nuclear power renewable fuels valuable chemicals said study co-author Alfred Spormann professor chemical engineering civil environmental engineering Stanford understand methanogens take electricity re-engineer conventional electrodes deliver electrons microbes faster rate study also provided new insights microbially influenced corrosion biological process threatens long-term stability structures made iron steel Biocorrosion significant global problem Spormann said yearly economic loss caused process estimated 1 billion range Methane microbes Methane important fuel heating transportation cooking generating electricity methane comes natural gas abundant fossil fuel extracted wells However burning natural gas emits carbon dioxide accelerates global warming Methanogens offer promising alternative single-celled organisms resemble bacteria belong genetically distinct domain called Archaea Commonly found sediments sewage treatment plants methanogens thrive carbon dioxide gas electrons byproduct primordial meal pure methane gas microbes excrete air Researchers trying develop large bioreactors billions methanogens crank methane around clock microbial colonies would fed carbon dioxide atmosphere clean electricity electrodes entire process would carbon neutral Spormann explained microbial methane burnt fuel carbon dioxide gets recycled back atmosphere originated said Natural gas combustion hand frees carbon trapped underground millions years Electron uptake Producing microbial methane industrial scale require major improvements efficiency Deutzmann said Right main bottleneck process figuring get electrons electrode microbial cell said first know electron uptake works methanogens engineer enhance electron-transfer rate increase methane production nature methanogens acquire electrons hydrogen molecules form breakdown organic material bacterial fermentation small molecules food microbes Deutzmann said provide methanogens electrons metabolize carbon dioxide produce methane Spormann lab methanogens don't worry food Electrons continuously supplied low-voltage current via electrode electrons get methanogen cell subject scientific debate leading hypothesis many microbes including methanogens take electrons directly electrode Deutzmann said previous study found evidence microbial enzymes molecules could also play role engineering perspective makes difference design electrode accommodate large microbial cells versus enzymes attach lot enzymes electrode enzymes lot smaller Experiments enzymes experiment Stanford team used species methanogen called Methanococcus maripaludis Cultures M maripaludis grown flasks equipped graphite electrode provided steady supply electrons microbes also fed carbon dioxide gas expected methane gas formed inside flasks clear indication methanogens taking electrons metabolizing carbon dioxide researchers also detected build-up hydrogen gas molecules hydrogen shuttling electrons methanogens occurs nature find Stanford team repeated experiment using genetically engineered strain M maripaludis mutant methanogens six genes deleted DNA could longer produce enzyme hydrogenase microbes need make hydrogen Although mutants grown conditions normal methanogens methane output significantly lower hydrogenase absent culture methane production plummeted 10-fold Spormann said strong indication hydrogen-producing enzymes significantly involved electron uptake tests without methanogen cells confirmed hydrogenase enzymes take electrons directly electrode surface microbial cell involved transfer widely assumed turns kinds enzymes floating around culture medium Deutzmann said enzymes attach electrode surface produce small molecules like hydrogen feed electrons microbes Normal methanogen cells produce variety enzymes Stirring starvation biological factors cause cells break open releasing enzymes culture medium Deutzmann said Biocorrosion know certain enzymes take electrons engineer work better search enzymes even faster added Another benefit longer design large porous electrodes accommodate entire methanogen cell Stanford team also discovered methanogen enzymes play similar role biocorrosion researchers found granules iron transfer electrons directly hydrogenase enzyme uses electrons make hydrogen molecules turn consumed methanogens Eliminating hydrogenase environment could slow rate corrosion according scientists first surprised results enzymes
