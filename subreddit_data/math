Aha Discrimination figment overactive imagination Vanished civil rights movement 1960 hardly really ever existed even like rare extinct Dodo woman member low status minority group even software

correlated membership target group correlation adverse effect pretext variable higher correlation membership target group Nonetheless adverse effect caused discrimination target group use pretext enables plausible deniability statistical studies anecdotally Pretexts course common politics Historically states United States used poll taxes literacy tests effectively exclude blacks voting without explicitly using race something presumably forbidden 14th amendment Constitution problem pretexts often subconscious semiconscious even conscious deliberate difficult prove absent iPhone video incriminating conversation behind closed doors discrimination cases sorting categorizing data set income level social class especially suspect Much issue discrimination people allegedly excluded employment income opportunities unfairly due sex race age factor Thus discrimination real social problem expect groups discriminated overrepresented low income categories lower social class categories may well compare men women whites blacks others matched income level social class evidence discrimination disappears even reverses mean discrimination occurring consequence discrimination evidence

successor particular successor set X denoted X union X X X contains every element X also contains X gives natural number n 0 1 2 n-1 it's successor union n n --that n 1 0 1 2 n-1 n notion succession means set theoretical sense move natural numbers ordinals particular Axiom Infinity says set X every Y X Y also X yielding infinite set Noting naturals numbers constructed see gives us single set N containing natural numbers happens take successor N though successor ad infinitum Simply repeating successor function natural numbers yields ordinals basically extension idea natural numbers natural numbers hand ordinals aside construct familiar number systems provided notion ordering ordinals already built notion ordering want extend cases easy enough--an ordered pair b represented unambiguously set b ordered triple b c represented b b c construct integers ordered pairs natural numbers--you define positive integer n pair 0 n negative integer -n 1 n Loosely speaking rational numbers defined ordered pairs integers b b real numbers defined usual ways Dedekind Cuts Cauchy Sequences rational numbers There's slightly two ordered pairs may represent rational number example 1 2 1 2 2 4 2 4 1 2

driver improve travel times others selflessly choosing slowest roads cannot help overall network without suffering form slower journey course option many choose old road Town Town B hugely inefficient inefficiency actually ensured network whole remained reasonably efficient served distribute traffic evenly two routes Start End improving relatively unimportant road simply redistributes traffic

language graphical linear algebra study extremely interesting useful concepts graph theory probably write point future Last time somewhat vaguely claimed 1-1 correspondence diagrams theory matrices natural number entries episode start discuss correspondence properly First though need understand matrices exactly would argue definition given Wikipedia today May 23 2015 overlong boring expected beloved internet creation actually wrong quote matrix rectangular array numbers mathematical objects Well tells part story ignores hairy corner cases working definition follows matrix natural number entries entity consists three things together natural number m tells us many columns another natural number n tells us many rows n m grid natural numbers write follows three small examples Maybe re thinking redundancy mean give rectangular array count numbers columns rows obtain two numbers point keeping extra information around corner cases come Consider following three matrices good drawing 15 0 0 3 0 0 grids natural numbers end looking bit empty hand three usually used represent different things feel right identify useful keep two extra numbers around help us get around small yet important deficiency standard notation subtle deficiencies matrix notation get around exposing later episodes define two operations matrices quite similar operations diagrams first direct sum action governed rule grid defined follows Note m slightly careless notation diagram two 0s reading left right respectively m n m n grids 0s entries instance Notice case diagrams direct sum commutative associative though given matrices B C bracketing matter B C B C example illustrates need keep extra information numbers columns rows see even though number grid empty 3 0 certainly feel direct sum something one final example Next operation composition usually known name matrix multiplication diagrams multiply two arbitrary matrices see composition work number rows equal number columns B Note also notational convention product write B even though think coming first e wrote BA number grid part composition B diagrams would written B big deal little notational quirk keep mind since BA grid numbers need way figuring entries formula governs BA ij refers entry ith row jth column worry memorising formula computers calculations us Using formula difficult prove matrix multiplication associative matrices B C composed C BA CB ve seen diagrams matrix multiplication commutative First pairs matrices makes sense multiply one way since rows columns match properly square matrices numbers columns rows find simple counterexamples commutativity one missing diagrams already Let face grids numbers pretty dull scratch itch two computations illustrated compositions diagrams prove diagrams matrices interchangeable define formal translation diagrams matrices Since refer quite bit may well give name say Greek letter theta start defining giving matrices generators four much work Next use observation diagrams subdivided write expressions feature basic generators identity twist composed together two operations diagrams demonstrated procedure get diagram expression Crema di Mascarpone Using insight matrix composite diagram obtained performing matrix operations matrices translations subcomponents definition saying order work matrix composition diagrams B first work matrices B separately multiply say something similar direct sum Note example recursive definition use right hand side two definitions reason makes sense eventually get generators identity twist base cases recursion thing remains explain deal wiring brief aside episodes ago claimed hard talk copying using traditional mathematical notation Since translated copy generator something scientists would recognise haven contradicted would argue translation really copy justice hidden baggage sense matrix algebra relies copy interacts addition equations B1 B4 sometimes useful keep copy isolated necessarily interact way generators may look quite similar addition know sounds bit mysterious bear come back point later Let work example get feeling works translate right hand side equation B1 matrix First decompose diagram expression features basic components Next use definition expressions turn right hand side equation expression matrices first two steps simply used defining equations first composition direct sum third step used definitions basic components direct summed matrices finally computed matrix product using Wolfram Alpha summing worked way defining even make sense problem many different ways writing diagram expression seen last episodes sometimes consider two diagrams look quite different thing one way writing one way applying gives matrix writing different expression applying gives different matrix B would well-defined could sure matrix corresponds particular diagram really worry fine three ways obtaining different expressions diagram subdivide diagram different way next episode use diagrammatic reasoning stretch tighten wires slide generators along wires use ten equations replace components diagrams tackle point 3 easily enough need check equation system matrices get left hand side right hand side example complete job B1 already worked matrix right hand side need consider left hand side applying two sides B1 gives matrix said equations system go ahead check leaves points 1 2 sure diagrammatic reasoning change matrix choose subdivide diagram different way reason issues cause problems diagrams matrices organise arrows two different symmetric monoidal categories old translation functor way getting one category another Moreover two symmetric monoidal categories special kind PROPs symmetric monoidal categories extra properties makes ideal fit graphical linear algebra lots cool graphical linear algebra want series descend discussion finer points category theory said back episode 2 amount category theory really need fairly modest point need enough order understand points 1 2

make interactive mathematical presentation son school 7th 8th grade Math Team 30 math-enthusiastic kids twelve thirteen years old along math teachers chair school math department topic game Nim game secret mathematical strategy enabling anyone secret knowledge win without great game kids strategy realistically expect beat parents friends siblings parent friends almost every single time play Nim one player sets number piles blocks opponent chooses whether go first second players take turns removing blocks player may remove number blocks least one one pile fine take whole pile whichever player takes last block wins math team played demonstration games able beat brave challengers kids paired play gain familiarity game time first strategy discussion could secret winning strategy explained kids trick mathematicians often use approaching difficult problem namely consider detail simple special cases boundary instances problem often happens special cases reveal way thinking problem applies much generally Perhaps one easiest special cases Nim occurs one pile one pile clearly one wants go first order make winning move take entire pile Two balanced piles slightly less trivial probably informative case arises exactly two piles stacks height kids realized second player could make copying moves preserve balanced situation key insight copying strategy winning strategy one always copy particular one move whenever opponent opponent never take last block two piles therefore one wants always make balanced initially unbalanced choose go first follow balancing strategy initially balanced choose go second copy whatever moves opponent makes rebalance balanced position insight difficult see winning leave position number pairs balanced piles One effect play pair separately whenever opponent makes move one piles one copy move corresponding partner pile way may count position overall balanced fundamental game-theoretic observation make balanced piles effect cancel position one ignore analyzing position two balanced piles present possibly complicated position one pretend aren precisely whenever opponent plays one copy move winning strategy position piles absent converted winning strategy balanced piles present idea provides complete winning strategy case piles height one two One wants leave position even number piles height one height odd number piles take whole pile height odd numbers piles height one two turn height-two pile pile height one make even unbalanced position balanced move balanced position unbalance 1 2 3 counts balanced Let consider may piles height three example consider basic position piles height one two three observation make move position replied move leaves balanced check sure follows position winning leave player one go second 1 2 3 would nice could consider position already balanced sense Indeed may incorporate situation balancing idea think pile height three really consisting two subpiles one height two one height one way Nim position 1 2 3 counts balanced since 3 counts 2 1 balances stacks 1 2 3 position two stacks height two two height one one regards stack height three substack height two substack height one way thinking produces complete winning strategy Nim positions involving piles height three strategy mastered even young children years ago talked Nim much younger children Math six-year-olds Win Nim first-graders daughter school time concentrated posititions piles height three Older kids however handle full strategy Namely winning strategy case strive balance position make even number overall piles height one two count piles height three one one two always give opponent balanced position win Faced unbalanced position fact always find balancing move move balanced position unbalance game starting deciding whether go first second determine whether balanced yet unbalanced go first make balancing move already balanced go second adopt copying strategy re-balance position move general winning strategy course goes beyond three key idea realize really going represent 3 2 1 using binary representation number 3 explain wrote following numbers chalkboard 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 cdots pleased

binary 1023 two hands general strategy view every Nim pile consisting subpiles whose height power two make sure one leaves position balanced sense every power two even number instances position think 3 really 2 1 purposes balancing 4 counts power two 5 counts 4 1 6 counts 4 2 7 4 2 1 Another way describe strategy express pile heights binary want even number 1 binary place position mathematical facts verify 1 move balanced position powers-of-two sense cause become unbalanced 2 unbalanced position balanced one move follows leaving balanced positions winning strategy winning move taking last block balancing move rather unbalancing move One prove statement 1 realizing move single stack binary representation changes whichever binary digits changed become unbalanced statement 2 consider largest unbalanced power two 2 k move stack contains 2 k size substack Since 2 k-1 111 cdots11 binary one attain binary pattern smaller height stacks removing 1 2 k many blocks one balance position practical matter proof 2 also shows one find winning balancing move otherwise difficult cases look largest unbalanced power two move pile containing subpile making sure leave balanced position actual instances Nim pile heights rarely tall one usually considering 1 2 4 powers two arise traditional starting configuration piles height 1 3 5 7 position balanced one may view 1 2 1 4 1 4 2 1 even number

perhaps surprisingly decrease efficiency journeys around even without increasing number trips made pointed recent article Braess Paradox take closer look reasoning behind paradox consider case illustrated two major cities labelled Start End locations journey Travellers two cities two choices route either via Town via Town B roads Start Town Town B End highways handle number cars allow make leg journey 105 minutes roads Start Town B Town End smaller roads slower busy N cars road leg journey takes N minutes old road linking Town Town B journey time 100 minutes road sufficiently slow traveller Start Finish would choose route involves Network illustrating Braess Paradox Travel times along routes listed minutes assume 100 cars travelling time Start End advantage going via Town vs going via Town B traffic split approximately 50 50 two routes car journey 155 minutes fastest route reality split cars might exactly 50 50 unless ratio heavily imbalanced average travel time across network 155 minutes Suppose network improved upgrading road Town Town B Rather taking 100 minutes travel towns takes 2 minutes fastest route drivers go Start Town B 100 minutes take 2 minute trip Town

travel times others selflessly choosing slowest roads cannot help overall network without suffering form slower journey course option many choose old road Town Town B hugely inefficient inefficiency actually ensured network whole remained reasonably efficient served distribute traffic evenly two routes Start End improving relatively unimportant road simply redistributes traffic unevenly worsens overall system Even counter-intuitively Braess Paradox observed simple physical systems well transport networks video illustrates system whereby weight suspended two springs connected series initially tense string parallel initially slack strings Removing string tension actually leads weight lifted upwards actually reverse traffic example distance weight hangs represents longer journey time traffic remove central string new road hanging distance reduced journey time traffic Paradox action paradox simply mathematical quirk one neglected network analysts number examples removing roads rather building news ones improved transport networks Probably famous example comes South Korea motorway network around Seoul reworked remove 1960s-built roadways result significantly reduced transit times

quashing fear sky may fall heads somehow graphical reasoning could let us unreasonable things like proving 2 3 Let convince counting armed hypothetical example Suppose diagram say two dangling wires left one right Let give first left wire name say p let call right wire q Suppose also ve cut diagram chunks like Crema di Mascarpone ve identified one particular diagram component called B one dangling wire left called r one right called diagram r drawn dangling B inside may connect components count number paths p q could write formula follows idea generalises easily enough think happens B multiple dangling wires left right counting tell us Well one count number paths p q really need look inside B need know number paths dangling points left points right particular swap B another diagram

arithmetic Like scientists biologists Carl Veller Martin Nowak Charles Davis stand shoulders giants one giant particular ecologist Daniel Janzen years cast huge number creative influential ideas unsettling ease mid-1970s Janzen came explanation bamboo plants would flower synchrony noted rats birds pigs animals devour colossal numbers bamboo seeds gobbled-up seed represents loss potential offspring enough seed-predators hungry enough wipe bamboo plant entire set seeds Bamboo plants might fare better Janzen argued flowered time would overwhelm enemies food Even gorged bursting would still leave seeds untouched surviving seeds would enough time grow plants could defend tough fibers bitter chemicals bamboos fell flowering lockstep would hard slide bamboo plants flowered years early animals would feast seeds out-of-sync genes would fail make future generations scientists found support Janzen idea Swamping enemies seeds really lower overall harm seed-eaters cause individual plant Veller colleagues still questions bamboo plants get beneficial flower cycles begin various species end long different flowering rhythms scientists developed mathematical model based known bamboo biology started bamboo forest almost plants flower annually bamboo species population also contained mutants mutations flower-timing genes needed two years flower instead one two-year mutants flowered even years others flowered odd years Spending two years flowering instead one could advantages bamboo plants plants could time gather energy sunlight could use make seeds give seeds defenses predators forest becomes two-year plants fewer plants releasing seeds every year Eventually Veller colleagues found year arrives annual bamboo plants produce enough seeds survive onslaught animals one fell swoop re wiped odd year odd-year two-year plants get wiped even year even-yeared plants take fall Either way whole forest gets abruptly synchronized flowering every two years also possible forest wouldn two-year mutants mutants took three years flower Veller colleagues found mathematical model bamboo plants longer flowering cycles could also take Exactly cycle won partly matter chance many seeds bamboo plants successfully produce given year fluctuate due weather unpredictable conditions Whichever cycle emerges dominant one whole forest evolves stay synchronized outliers flowering sync get wiped Janzen proposed one exception though mutant bamboo plant evolve new cycle multiple original one Imagine two-year bamboo turns four-year one Every year flowers protected two-year plants flowering time got advantage spend extra time making seeds Even though four-year flowers need twice long produce seeds scientists found conditions still become increasingly common centuries Eventually whole forest lock onto four-year cycle bamboo evolve way scientists found four-year forest produces two-year mutant flower half time years protection predators direction go towards longer cycles four-year forest produces eight-year mutant advantage four-year plants originally well-protected time Veller colleagues realized could test model millions years reasoned species multiplied flowering

mathematics usually delivered students knowledge upon trust knowledge particularly mystical variety magical symbols come together incomprehensible ways myth need dispel knowledge need kids digest Sometimes Algebra nothing way write knots properties Last session using notation developed together went well One unexpected hick-up fact students seen parentheses took stride also hadn use variables examples concrete little use variables made confusing even introduced proper maths terminology Big Maths Words First asked give names composition operation came reasonable suggestions gluing linking joining told Big Math Word composition liked like music compose song notes Indeed also reasonable suggestions tensor things stacking building didn much like Big Math Word tensor like much confess first 20 minutes went new tidied notation rest time 30 minutes worked examples going drawn knot formula easy fact quite challenge try exercises often got things wrong One pervasive error getting confused repeated tensoring stacking tangles K K K often written K K K interesting error Tomorrow session finally reach equations already seen equation noticed developing notation First start similar

usually going explicitly say two diagrams different consider different possible show using rules equal Anyway convenient cheat sheet equations met far save unnecessary clicking episodes hinted back Episode 3 graphical linear algebra something say counting plan today focus attention particular class diagrams exactly one dangling wire left right turns diagrams closely related natural numbers non-negative integers 0 1 2 example makes lot sense associate following diagrams corresponding numbers Remember intuition numbers travelling wires Well associating numbers diagrams compatible example let consider sending number x left dangling wire diagram associating number 3 output x x x 3x whatever input diagram acts multiplying 3 look diagrams 0 1 2 idea also nice graphical intuition play number associated diagram number paths dangling point left dangling point right diagram 0 paths left right 2 two different paths graphical intuition important come back soon Although quite cute correspondence numbers diagrams merely skin deep discover algebra diagrams allows us perform basic operations arithmetic addition multiplication Thus slogan far linear algebra happens adding copying meet actually extreme even basic idea natural numbers explained adding copying start defining translation numbers diagrams useful us syntactic sugar expression syntactic sugar probably quite familiar programmer means construction useful part language actually add anything new language become expressive Syntactic sugar always translated away phrases may convenient several reasons exactly case us syntactic sugar family special diagram components one natural number start good friend 0 use special notation indicate actually defining thing left terms things already know reason name base define syntactic sugar recursively definition base case recursion recursive case Maybe seen use recursion something many first year Computer Science undergraduates scared know personal experience reason look

starting 1 use rec get first equality base Unit Counit diagram corresponds 1 simply identity Let 3 use rec rec use knowledge diagram 1 discovered simply identity important confuse syntactic sugar natural number number travelling wire per standard intuition fact sugar acts multiplying input number represents like Let prove one prove something natural numbers could start showing holds individual

I've earned keep Following standard conference networking maxims though made effort meet least one coffee shop I've met introduce least one new coffee shop another attending talks enjoyed listening work tensor spectral clustering Benson Gleich Leskovec got thinking larger issue modeling higher-order interactions appear many different ways modeling problem problem Imagine number interacting entities could points space vertices graph even dimensions point aka variables easiest way model collection entities assume they're independent example might draw d samples distribution might looking collection independent features describing object Independence assumptions powerful allow us factorize structure combinations individual elements either leads simple summations directly eventually log transformation product means deal entities independently inference complexity blowup linear number entities good example Naive Bayes approach learning assuming entities independent leads likelihood cost function that's sum terms one entity I'm necessarily rather loose statements Making precise possible specific contexts gets unwieldy independence restrictive assumption limits modeling power therefore unable capture interactions might make understanding structure lot easier one thing you'd never find correlations assumed features independent Graphs easiest form interaction pairwise interaction Modeling pairwise interactions gets us graph doesn't love graph importantly follows graph associated structures rich representation system pairwise interactions colorful vocabulary arsenal algorithms talking pairwise interactions structures built course we've paid price - complexity Instead linear cost incurred independent entities quadratically many potential pairwise interactions model here's key interpret sparse graph capturing weak interactions it's still rich model model different phenomena Higher-order interactions happens want model interactions aren't pairwise correct higher-order structure model interactions effectively graphs turns many different ways reduced sentence pace Saunders MacLane form graph special kind X different values X 1 graphical model view graph special kind clique intersection structure 2-cliques One way manage collection higher order interactions factorize general way basis clique-tree idea graphical models interaction structure viewed set complete joint interactions aka cliques connected together tree structure easy inference Another name would 'bounded treewidth' model misses fact allowing higher-order interactions controlled way advantage representation true parametrized complexity way isolates true complexity coming size clique overall complexity size graph spectral perspective graphs arise natural sources data social networks like deal noise spurious signals simple language connectivity paths longer robust enough example graph might connected there's one edge connecting two huge components edge spurious we've made huge mistake modeling graph structure Spectral methods currently best way dealing noisy interactions focusing topological structure connectivity amount connectivity measured via cuts spectral analysis graphs become perhaps best way finding structures large graphs spectral lens sees graph random walks edges great modeling collection pairwise interactions entities modeling interactions among sets entities careful Spectral methods actually quite good finding community structure graphs e partition sets vertices can't find higher order partitionings graphs e sets triangles sets special 4-vertex structures that's next three higher-order methods enter picture 2 algebraic topology view graph 1-skeleton simplicial complex we're looking model higher-order interactions need language describing

means simplex b c different three simplices b b c c even though first must contain second simplicial complex topological object generalizes graph graph get limit simplices size 2 it's discrete topological object play using tools topology particular powerful tools like homology homotopy reveal kinds hidden structure accessible via graph metaphor simplicial complexes allow express higher

Propositions 1 4 first paper 3 correspond exactly four steps fifth step second paper 4 1 product two numbers sum two squares sum two squares well known property based identity due Diophantus Alexandria 2 number sum two squares divisible prime sum two squares quotient sum two squares Euler's first Proposition Indeed suppose example divisible latter prime divides Since prime divides one two

using Diophantus identity 3 number written sum two squares divisible number sum two squares quotient factor sum two squares Euler's second Proposition Suppose divides quotient factored prime factors factors written sums two squares divide successively etc applying previous step deduce quotient sum two squares get concluding would sum two squares contraposition sum two squares least one primes sum two squares 4 relatively prime every factor sum two squares Euler's Proposition 4 proof sketched includes proof Proposition 3 step uses infinite descent Let factor write half absolute value gives Therefore must divisible say relatively prime gcd must relatively prime else common factor gcd would also common factor assume relatively prime Thus square gcd divides divides giving us expression form relatively prime half since relatively prime use directly instead switching sum two squares third step must factor sum two squares call gives infinite descent going smaller number sums two squares dividing sum two squares Since infinite descent impossible conclude must expressible sum two squares claimed 5 Every prime form sum two squares main result Euler's second paper Fermat's Little Theorem numbers congruent one modulo differences therefore divisible differences factored Since prime must divide one two factors cases divides first factor previous step conclude sum two squares since differ relatively prime enough show cannot always divide second factor divides differences would divide differences successive terms differences differences forth Since th differences sequence

competitions primary high school Although finally m become programmer m still interested physics maths try understand things mainly physics problem see many things papers lecture notes described terse plain rigorous way Even maths lecture college presented way often feeling lecturer showing often thought playing game telling everything students way chance understand constrant something described examples problems analogies intuition induction telling patterns even understanding sophisticated concept becomes easy intuitive foundations built generalize N fields etc discover corner cases gotchas backtrack towards axioms towards desired level real life see things explained way around axioms definition definition definition definition definition theorem proof theorem proof theorem proof theorem proof definition definition definition definition definition theorem proof theorem proof theorem proof theorem proof easy get lost beginning look like meaningless symbol folding easy get lost missing something like deciphering program starting silicon learning build x86 CPU reading machine code reading nicely commented source code without even knowing anything gory details hardware Personally cannot think differentiation without visualizing slope thinking rate change also cannot think integration without visualizing area graph thinking summation Visualizing matrix determinant area parallelogram 2 2 parallelepiped 3 3 great eye opener know determinant 0 special ve also found saying x y sign plain Enlish much easier understand simply writing xy 0 like maths like puzzles like solving problems like understanding world prove many theorems use mathematical tools need excess rigor Probably m thinking way m engineer use maths inventing heck discovered reinvented many things way learned Reply 19 August 2013 6 17 Daniel m sure analogy CPU hardware accurate although illustrate point Maybe drawn understanding fundamentals machine language mean code computer actually understands sure m using right term would accurate fundamental definitions theorems etc one step away topics discussed whereas hardware software need bridging case analogy still true think one reason rigor necessary ensure one knows might used secondly demonstrate manner one establishes concept think would allow student perhaps replicate rigorous path different concept perhaps new one seems difference math student engineering physics student former focused concept later usage Rigor remains impenetrable us though one gets used admittedly magic trick effect produce useful result Reply 27 November 2013 11 18 chris think one reason rigor necessary ensure one knows might used secondly demonstrate manner one establishes concept think quite opposite hardcore mathematicians put lot emphasis formalism rigor hard time relating real world concepts show extremely poor skills properly using math different fields like programming comes real world software production Actually mathematicians make poor programmers engineers Also typical math proofs required real world applications sometimes proofs actually misleading real world testing validation Reply 19 September 2013 8 57 Three quarters
