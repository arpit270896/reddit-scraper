60 Tracking shrinking motion atoms they're cooled NASA JPL-Caltech One abiding mysteries physics make transition quantum classical objects exceptions live world clearly obviously classical nature Quantum mechanics often defies everyday expectations poses problem classical world classical constructed objects really don't behave like classical objects several ideas transition occurs makes distinctive predictions Unfortunately experiments necessary test predictions really difficult since may need observe cumulative effect many small changes new paper published Physical Review Letters shows experiments may finally possible might quantum classical transition look like get cloud atoms cold enough wave-like nature individual atoms expands overlap atoms start behaving like quantum objects instance Bose Einstein condensate BEC atoms stay together rather diffuse atoms behave collectively like single quantum object Even cannot form BEC even temperature low enough BEC might form wave-like qualities individual atoms still overlap atoms case atoms attracted repelled mixing waves rather colliding like pair billiard balls atom slowly meanders cloud atoms jumps bit depending mixing wave natures surrounding atoms kicks also speed atom increasing temperature cloud happens wave nature atom starts shrink begins behave classically carefully examining gas cold atoms expands kicks evaluated transition quantum classical tracked changed makes new experiments possible making coldest gas known Universe that's work builds cooling techniques used produce BECs temperatures nanoKelvin range required obtain temperatures several different techniques used approaches intrinsic limit keeps gas nanoKelvin temperatures higher cool Cooling atoms nanoKelvin range usually multistep process first step called optical molasses name suggests uses set lasers slow atoms I've described see sidebar Cooling atomsThe typical optical cooling method exceptionally cool bit physics Think gas atoms fantastic time life's mosh pit flying directions bouncing one another vim vigor good things life old dude turn complain noise generally suck entertainment life everything slows Slowing everything easiest way think cooling physics old dudes take form lasers choose color laser correctly atoms gas absorb light go ground state excited state consider atom flying away laser see color slightly redder would since color right won't absorb Likewise atom flying towards laser observe light slightly bluer color won't absorb Doppler shift allows cooling take place cool bunch atoms laser color slight red chosen atoms moving slowly absorb light atoms moving towards laser bit fast absorb photon get momentum kick slow get rid energy emitting photon emitting photon get second kick random direction assuming arrange bunch lasers correctly average atom slowly cools moving slow enough absorb light lasers Text previous article issue optical cooling slower atoms go less efficient cooling becomes atoms become colder precisely need control color lasers making experiments technically difficult Even ultimately overcome problems transitions ground excited state something called width describes range colors effectively absorbed drive atom ground state excited state presence atoms broaden width making wider range colors drive atomic transition everything's cooled enough laser start excite atoms standing still temperature decrease limits optical cooling start dominate researchers switch sort evaporative cooling cold atoms held magnetic bowl coldest atoms sit bottom bowl hot atoms spend time higher side bowl stay magnetic bowl direction atom's internal magnetic field atoms rather like bar magnets anti-aligned magnetic field bowl magnetic field atom flipped would driven trap magnetic field trap also changes energy levels atom energy required flip orientation atom's magnetic field depends atom trap means hottest atoms selectively removed gas shining carefully chosen radio frequency cloud atoms Evaporative cooling also limited can't cool indefinitely end smaller smaller number atoms two options allow researchers cool cloud atoms temperatures required observe quantum classical transitions accurately need Turning cold 11 obtain atoms picoKelvin 10-12K range researchers used nice trick atoms cooled nanoKelvin range magnetic bowl removed cloud shot upwards vacuum cloud moves starts expand However instead letting cloud freely expand researchers applied new magnetic field point view atoms looks like lens idea stop cloud expanding moves Atoms hit lens closest outside experience larger force due magnetic field result outward motion slowed atoms traveling right center lens experience force cloud passed lens continues expand along direction moving transverse expansion expansion sideways compared direction travel slowed drastically cloud described two temperatures direction motion still temperature 2nK transverse direction however temperature 50pK 40 times less start though Like lenses magnetic lens intrinsic limit well focus case collimate atoms Ultimately limitation given quantum uncertainty atom's momentum position lensing technique performed physical limits cloud's transverse temperature would end femtoKelvin 10-15 would absolutely incredible really nice side effect combinations lenses used like telescopes compress expand cloud leaving transverse temperature cold may possible tune strongly atoms' waves overlap control speed transition quantum classical occurs would allow researchers explore transition large range conditions make
